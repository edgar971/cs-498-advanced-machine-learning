Earnie is a legit artist which you can tell by his amazing paintings at the shop. I also got my nose pierced there. Mr. Grooves & the whole staff are super cool.

As usual, the place was hopping when I arrived.  Transaction was completed quickly and I was out the door with my order.  All happy - until I got home and realized that my order was incomplete.  Rec'd only the appetizer & rice, but neither of the 2 main dishes I'd ordered.  Now I'm NOT happy. 

Called to inform Flo's of the problem, talked to a ""manager"".  She was snippy and basically told me it was my fault for walking out with only 1 bag when they had 2 for the order.  Yes, and how was I supposed to know that??  I requested credit back to my credit card, more discussion, finally she says ""I'm not going to argue with you"" and hung up.  Huh, what has this conversation been then?  Several days later I found my credit card had been credited back.  Hurray, I won't have to dispute the charge with my credit card company.

Flo's - you screwed up and blamed it on me.  Your food isn't that great anyway and your attitude is worse.  Think about adding some customer service to your menu.  In the meantime I'll find another restaurant that actually wants my business.",7,8,1

The parking lot was packed but our party was seated very quickly and our drinks were brought to us in a timely manner. I decided on the French toast, which was described as two thick cut pieces of bread with a heavy egg batter. I also opted to add bananas and their homemade whip cream. I was really looking forward to my meal, especially after seeing it get served to the table next to us. It looked delicious! 

What I was served was 3 limp pieces of bread with barely any egg batter and 5 brown banana slices. Yes, I counted them. I asked the server about it and pointed out what should have been the proper dish at the table next to us and she told me that ""they ran out of the right bread after I put the order in"". Okay, that's fine, but it's not my fault. She didn't even offer an apology which is what frustrated me. She should have came out WHEN she found out and asked if I wanted to change my order, because I totally would have. It also wasn't even discounted or anything on our bill (in my opinion it should have been because I got crap compared to what the dish actually looked like).

Overall my first visit was very disappointing.",9,1,0

We ordered the filet each, mashed potato, asparagus and salad to share.  The filet was terrible, poor grade, at the price should cut with a butter knife.  Asparagus was woody, mashed was good as well as the salad.  No rolls, they serve no rolls.  The toffee dessert was excellent, should have just had that.  Mostly upset with the filet, fine quality you should be able to cut with a butter knife and not chewy.  Wonder if the steakhouse has the same quality.",0,0,0

I was recommended by my co worker to get a Brazilian wax I have been waxing for 8 years and been to a lot of people. First of all I have to say the prices are super cheap. First time clients pay only $20 then $35 after which is still way cheaper than all the places I have been to. I have paid up to $65 and that is a lot. Jennifer was the one to do my Brazilian and she was awesome very fast and it was not painful like other places I have been to she has a soft touch. She was amazing I loved it and she did an amazing job. I will definitely be back to the birthday suit. The place is very very clean and they are all very professional. I will do the 30 min drive just to have a good experience here and feel comfortable. I will recommend every one I know here.,1,0,0

I placed an order at 6pm online, and shortly after received a confirmation email that my order would take 45-90 minutes. 7:45pm rolled around and I still hadn't received my delivery, so I decided to call them up and find out what the ETA on my order would be. The girl who picked up told me (her words, not mine) that my order had been ""lost in translation"" because it was a busy night and they had a lot of orders coming in. When asked why nobody had bothered to notify me between then and the time I had initially placed my order 2 hours prior to this conversation, I got another half-assed ""we're busy"" type response, followed by ""we can have your order delivered in another hour and a half,"" and a credit for ""next time."" At this point, if I hadn't (obviously) canceled my order, I'd have had to wait a total of THREE HOURS for my meal to arrive. Not once did they apologize, either.

About an hour and a half later I posted a tweet reiterating my frustrations at Magic Oven and within 2 minutes I had a call from them informing me they ""saw my tweet"" and essentially wondering what the issue was since they had ""offered me a credit,"" which I don't even want, because ordering from here again is out of the question at this point.

A word of advice to whoever is running this joint: Calling a very obviously frustrated customer at 10:30pm on a weeknight with what is essentially a poor excuse of a ""solution"" for a very poorly run business (once again, not a single apology on their end) is not the way to go about things.",1,1,0

b4cBVKn5yY0Heop3YMm3Fg,WUb8KUdRjdOzA2TVNke9Ow,eoJfl5vG7X87QhcKb0nt5Q,1,2014-10-16,"So, it's great that this massive biergarden\/resto has activated Chester Avenue across from the Greyhound Station.   As I strolled toward HH last night, I was struck by how many more people were on Chester.   Many, many more than Ive seen in the past.

That's great.

However, aside from  2-3 bright spots, Im afraid to say that HH's soft opening is not going well from a service perspective and the quality\/value of their food is poor.

What's good?

The physical space is beautiful.  It's a wide open, boisterous frat party atmosphere ...even on a Wednesday night.   With the polka band playing, the crowd large and vocal and an overall mood of ""Let's party"", the moment you step in the door, through an entryway half-heartedly stocked with over-priced t-shirts and steins, you know the purpose is for you to have a blast.

Also good?   Bar snacks.    The two our group tried were fresh, tasty and enjoyable.   The pretzels hawked from baskets, for cash only, are soft, perfectly salty and accompanied by a tangy mustard.   Perfect.   Secondly, the ping-pong sized sauerkraut balls eventually arrived (more on this later and they may have been another group's that we snagged out of desperation) and they were good.  Six round balls of fresh-tasting kraut were served with a creamy mustard that accented the greasy treats perfectly.   Win on both.

Finally, the seating is fun.   Packed in at long tables with strangers sounds less fun than it is.   We had a lot of social time with three CWRU neuroscience students who were good-natured, chatty and charming.

The beer is fine, but not remarkable.   We are spoiled here in CLE with great breweries.   HH has a lot of competition and Im not sure their Deutschland recipes are all that special as to warrant a special trip.   Again, its ok beer, but the dark, Oktoberfest and wheat beer wereacceptable but nothing special.

The bad?    Too many to list, but I'll give the highlights.

Service time.  We waited ONE HOUR AND TWENTY minutes from the moment we placed our food order until it FINALLY (FINALLY!) arrived.   Repeated attempts to find our server and multiple requests as to our food location brought the same wan response ""I'll check on it"".   Yes, it's a soft opening, but that is ridiculous.

We witnessed multiple double orders (guests were served their food, then 5 minutes later a runner brought the same folks the same order of food, which was obviously a duplicate order.). Massive staff confusion and back\/forth.   There's a problem in the kitchen.

Once our mains FINALLY arrived, the server, because of room flow, could not get to our location and had to pass our food down the table through four other guests to reach us.   The food was not worth the wait.   A pasta dish was barely better than Kraft Mac and Cheese and the side salad that was to accompany it was nonexistent and never made it out of the kitchen.   A pork dish was sloppily sauced with leaden dumplings and an unappealing presentation with food ""bunched up""on one side of the plate.    An entree salad had poor quality lettuce with a deep fried pork cutlet hacked into pieces and dumped on top with a warm bacon dressing that looked eerily like jarred chicken gravy.    All at a premium price.    Im happy to pay $15 bucks for good pasta, but for something I can make at home for much less, I expect something that tastes good.

As for room flow, there is a focus on maximizing space to increase revenue, but it comes at the expense of providing a smooth traffic flow.   In the NW corner of the cavernous room, there is no way for servers to circulate without going all the way around a huge room and then backtracking.    Remove one table to create an easy way to circulate.   This one needs to happen STAT.

There are not enough menus, silverware, or napkins available.   Repeated requests for these items brought zero response.   We ended up cadging all of these items by travelling to other tables and patching them together (2 napkins here, 1 napkin there - thank goodness for the kindness of strangers.).  

The polka band is fun, but in the cavernous space, it is LOUD.   There is no chance of conversation.   Know before you go, anything beyond 1-3 word shouting comments is nigh impossible.   This is the kind of place it is, so be aware.   

All told, even if this was a soft opening, the beer is not anything special, the food value is poor\/nonexistent and the systems (which are expected to be shaky during a soft opening) are SO BAD that it's going to take several months to shake them out.

I won't be back.   Too many other great locations in CLE.   I wish them the best, but don't have high hopes.   It appears that this new venture is relying on the brand ""sizzle"" (a Hofbrauhaus here!  Yay!) without investing in the core ""steak"" of excellent beer, toothsome, hearty food and effiecient service.

We had a flat tire in the airport parking after getting back from a week long trip.  We brought the car into tire works and they filled the tire with Nitrogen.  They mentioned that the tire had been checked for any issues or punctures.  Of course, two days later the tire was flat (again) so we brought it in to Tire Works for the second time.  After a 2 hours wait, they finally looked at my tire and decided that there was a nail embedded in the Tire.  I asked them why they didn't see that two days ago if they checked over the tire properly, and they said it just happened the the last two days since I brought it there.  Hmmmm...same slow leak, same flat tire....I doubt that they really checked my tire in the first place.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt.

Fast forward a few months and the alternator went in our car.  For over $400, we were able to get another alternator put in our car by Tire Works.  A few weeks later our car breaks down a couple hundred miles away and guess what it is??? The alternator is bad!  Sucks for us though, because we have to somehow pay to get our car back to Tire Works in order for them to fix the car.  So either we have to pay for a new alternator AGAIN as well as labor costs, and hope that Tire Works will refund us our money from a few weeks prior.  Or we have to pay almost a thousand dollars to get our car towed from where we broke down back to Las Vegas.

What I think is the most hilarious is that the NUMBER ONE reason to go to Tire Works according to their web site states. ""We stand behind our service and products. If for any reason you are not really pleased, we'll make it right for you. Period.""  I call BS on that one.  

Don't even bother calling their corporate offices.  I spoke with Heather who was absolutely no help.  She let me know that her ""boss"" said she can't do anything to help us.  When I asked what her boss' name was she told me she couldn't give me that information or let me talk to her.  WHO SAYS THAT?  The mechanic at one of the shops tells me that I could have spoken to Kristen or Michelle, but unfortunately I don't think anyone in that office is looking out for their customers.

I would never go to Tire Works unless you want a huge headache and to feel like you've lost hundreds (or thousands) of dollars in their hands.",19,0,3

We ordered the appetizer platter and after my first bite of the mini taco I asked everyone if we should leave.  Everyone said no since we already ordered.  That first bite was a very good insight to what our meal would be like.  

We all ordered full meals on top of the appetizer and were very disappointed.  Everything tasted like cafeteria style food.  Not one fresh, quality dish was served.  The beans tasted canned and scorched, the rice was overly bland and the chicken fajitas and flour tortillas were rubbery.  A shredded pork salad was ordered and was not any better.

The menu was expansive with many amusing entree names so it took a while to decide what we wanted but when we finally did we waited only for the server to come back and say they were out of several of the items and then came back and said they were out of an additional item.

It was so bad that I had to come all the way back (wait some more) and exchange the car out. They said I could get an upgrade for the inconvenience but of course nothing was available. To top it all off the temporary authorization they put on my car that they said was released went through... Now they won't even pick up the phone when I call. Awesome time. Oh wait... Just kidding.,1,0,0

They will try to sell you a home warranty for your appliances. It will come out to about 600 a year at 49 a month. The service call will only cost 80 dollars which will include parts and labor. 
I did not opt for the warranty. My diagnostic fee alone was 99 which did not include parts and labor--although the description states if you move forward with repair the fee will apply towards parts and labor. I did find a 20% off coupon online and used it. My repair with the discount and fee applied toward parts and labor was approximately 250.00. 
I feel if I had shopped around this repair might have been less expensive. But since I'm not certain of this I can't dock the rating.",1,0,0

fellow yelper, elizabeth b., was raving about it recently and recommended that i check one out.
after my haircut, i remembered that there was a patty's closet in the same shopping center, so i decided to go see what all the fuss was about.

i am so glad i did.

the concept is fantabulous.
in case you didn't know, let me just tell you.
they only carry 6 pieces of each item and maybe a total of 100 items (possibly less) and once they're sold out, you can never purchase them again.
it makes the items seem more unique especially if you know that the likelihood of seeing someone else wearing it is slim.
another great thing about patty's closet is the affordability.
the highest ticket price i saw was $35 for a dress, everything else was around the $20 mark.
i walked out of there with 2 pairs of pants, 4 tops and a hat for around $150.
phenomenal deal!

melissa, the franchise owner of this particular location, was beyond helpful.
from the moment i walked through the door to the moment i left, she was attentive, friendly and made a lot of really great suggestions.
the level of service i received was beyond anything i've ever experienced in a retail environment.
you get the rodeo drive, high end boutique experience without the snootiness that usually comes with that pleasure.
think julia roberts in pretty woman.
patty's closet is the opposite of that.

i'm most definitely a fan.

Easyflow wanted to SMASH HOLES in the drywall to get to the part. I simply used ordinary tools and removed the broken thread from the elbow, cleaned it up and installed a new shower pipe.A little investigation on my part resulted in these findings.First the ""Legal"" baloney..this is my personal OPINION and findings and I am entitled to it..now here goes. Easyflow is the same company as ""L & S Heating and Air Conditioning"" (Read THOSE reviews).This company has contracts with the home warranty companies which pay VERY low per call.They use outside contractors and pay them low too.This is why you will never get a same day show-up.The guys that respond might be experienced or some general handyman trying hard to make a buck.They can only do what the company allows (Substandard at best).You CAN tell your home warranty company due to the reviews you see about this company DO NOT SEND Easyflow\/L&S ! These fly by night companies would not be in business if it wasn't for these home warranty companies.If you check the ""BBB"" Better Buisness site you will find that Easyflow has a ""F"" rating.I have made SURE that the owner of this property, the Property Management company as well as the Home Warranty companies know about this company.They have been placed on the DO NOT CALL list for this property and I am sure others.From what I have been able to get from asking a lot of questions is this. The people that finally show up are not the problem, it's Easyflow.The service guys are independent contractors themselves and not direct employees.You can't really blame them, but Easyflow is jerking them around too.These people show up in personal vehicles with no markings, they carry ZERO parts and stock nothing.Parts are furnished by Easyflow (used sometimes) or purchased locally (Home Depot).My advise is to closely inspect\/examine your home warranty coverage.This is what THEY will send you.On a personal note....THANKS FOR NOTHING Easyflow.I now fully understand how your business clings to life and without the home warranty contracts you would be out of business quickly as a real\/honest business would never do what you do to customers.I hope this helps others avoid the trouble I had with you.",4,0,2

Afterwards, we eat in the foodcourt together. It's a weekly affair so this is definitely a loss for infamous laffa.

I ordered a shwarma laffa for myself and a plate of felafel from the kids menu for my son. The felafel plate is 6.99. This teenager makes my laffa. He does an AMAZING JOB. WOW, enough food for 2 people and delicious. Thumbs up.

Then comes my son's felafel plate. I'm asked to wait at the side while it's prepared. The menu says ""served with rice or fries and a can of pop"". I ask if they can put a little less rice and a few fries. Big deal! Right? Apparently so. I'm told first that the felafel plate only comes with 4 felafel balls and no rice or fries. I argue and the manager says""
a. he's been working there for 3 years (the place has been open a matter of weeks). 
b. he says I ordered the felafel plate and it doesn't have rice or fries or a drink, it's 6.99. I should look at the menu. I point to where it is on the kids menu. He insists I ordered from the felafel plate on the adult menu and says I should read it. But he can't seem to point to it on the menu because it's only on the kids menu. 

So he agrees to give me what I ordered. But then he says no rice and fries, either or, no exceptions. Like screw you buddy. So I said fine, just rice and then asked for some of the salads. He said no.

Let me make this clear. The kids felafel plate and the adult felafel plate (which isn't on the menu btw) and the felafel in a pita are all 6.99. In the pita they put everything you want, but on the plate, it's either rice or fries and the salads they normally put in your pita you can't have. So the felafel plate is rice and felafel balls and NO salads. Just 4 dry felafel balls and some rice... oh and you don't get the drink. 

So my son didn't get his felafel. I demanded a refund. The shawarma was good, hence one star, but I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. None of the 4 of us, nor our children will ever eat there again. BTW, the people at Aroma are really nice.

They were so rude, even yelling at me. If could curse at them on yelp, I would.",12,4,3

The toppings go to the edge and it's cut in to squares. Since the pizza is round, this means you get 4 ""corner"" pieces, which are actually triangles. Add some of the grated parmesan cheese and these are the best little bite. We've yet to deviate from the basic toppings... cheese, pepperoni, sausage, or pepperoni\/sausage. It's just so yummy.

There are times when we go more than once in a week, so you may want to try something different. The white pizza is a nice change or the italian hoagie is good as well. Sometimes I get a hoagie and pizza because I want a little of both. Either way, yummy!!

I like that you can dine in and grab a pitcher of beer. It's a good casual place for a delicious bite to eat. If by chance you have some left over pizza, don't expect a box because you won't get one. Your pizza will be moved to smaller pizza round cardboard with and placed in a white paper bag. It sounds weird, but to those of us that go, it's totally normal.

We were looking at one of the apartments with the pool view, it was a bit more for rent, but we thought it being worth it to be closer to the pool and the amenities. After putting in our application and selecting our location we asked if we could view the apartment we would be living in, they seemed very annoyed with us and informed us that their residents don't usually view the apartment before move-in. I was very persistent and informed them that It was not unreasonable for me to ask to view the apartment considering it was vacant. I now know why they were so hesitant. When they finally agreed to allow us to view the apartment we walked in to absolute filth! There were dead bugs and dust on the window seal, closets, bathrooms, and all corners of the apartment. There was urine on the toilet seat, there was painters tape that was lifting where someone did a half assed job and just painted over it. The carpet was stained throughout and in the master bedroom had a giant bleach stain. I brought this to the attention of the apartment, they said they would have the cleaning crew come back through, but they would not be able to fix the carpet. My husband and I decided to offer to pay for them to replace the damaged carpet. Our offer was denied and they found it unreasonable for us to ask for it to be fixed. They said in no case would they make an exception for this. Shortly after us leaving upset they called us and informed us they would have all the small things fixed by our move-in and we could view it then. They assured me that my family and I would be very happy living there and everything on our list would be fixed. I called to see if It was possible for them to have things fixed prior to move in just incase there's anything wrong. At this point the ladies in the office became very disrespectful and rude. 
I received a call A few days before our move-in that they were unable to have the cleaning crew to come through, but again it would be ready for us on our move-in date. Come our move-in, we show up and asked to see the apartment. They were persistent in having us sign our lease before viewing the apartment, I told them I would not feel comfortable signing a lease until I knew it was in livable conditions for my family and I. They gave in and allowed us to see it. Nothing was fixed or cleaned, except it did look like they ran a vacuum through the apartment and sprayed some air freshener. I was so upset they didn't fallow through with any of their promises they had made and I let them know that. We ended up going out that same day and finding an amazing apartment to move into. After going through this experience I would NEVER recommend anyone I know to move into Trillium.",2,0,0

Went as a group of four and collectively tried: scallops, branzino, lamb, black kale, polenta, and savoy cabbage.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the mains are presented without any accompaniment - ex, scallops are literally three small scallops for $36.  Sides must be ordered separately.  We were willing to overlook this but unfortunately each and every dish was terrible.

I had the scallops which were hard - crispy and rubbery.  Another friend had lamb which he said was terrible.  The branzino was the best dish but likely only bc my friend ordered it specifying no salt and no oil.  The black kale was extremely salty but edible.  The polenta was so salty it was literally inedible.  The savoy cabbage was sickly sweet and so terrible that we had to send it back.

Only ok menu items were alcohol (out of a bottle) and gelato (out of a box).

I will give props to the servers.  Our server seemed aware of how atrocious the food was and replaced the savoy cabbage immediately.

Not sure what the restaurant owners are thinking - great location, beautiful ambience, but absolutely atrocious food.  I would not recommend dining here, even out of curiosity.  Stick to a drink on the patio at most and don't let the promising sounding food menu tempt you.  Absolutely vile.",2,0,0

I lived here only for 9 months before I was more than ready to go. So I'll post my review AGAIN... they screw you over big time on the fees to move out. I paid non refundable pet fees for both my Yorkies. I also had to pay $25 extra per dog per month. When I finally moved out they charged me cleaning fees for the carpet after I had already shampooed it and the carpet looked brand-new. Why couldn't they use any of my nonrefundable pet deposit and initial (also nonrefundable) deposit to pay for the $40 carpet cleaning fee is beyond me, but hey it's whatever. Another thing that upset me is I gave them less than 60 days notice I would not be renewing my lease and because of that I had to pay a prorated amount of rent to cover the full 60 days. Which was ridiculously expensive. I think I was maybe 50 days out from my lease expiring. Isn't that what a lease is for? If I didn't ask to renew it, why should I be penalized for not giving you a 60 day notice. It's in writing when I intend to vacate the premises. They were also going to increase my rent $60 a month if I decided to stay. That to me is absolutely absurd. My apartment was very poorly insulated so I heard screaming and crying kids, people coughing and anything else you could think of every day. My electric bill during the summer was outrageous for the size of the apartment I lived in (just under 1,000 sq ft and I kept it at 80 all the time and my bill got up to $240). I lived in the very first building on the right and parking was always super terrible. If you work shiftwork good luck finding a parking spot when you get home.

When I arrived at the Galleria location, the person at the desk told me that she couldn't make me an appointment (which apparently she could). Then, they took me in to examine me as an urgent care patient (even though that's not really why I came), and both the nurse and the doctor said, ""Oh yes, we can make you an appointment before you leave."" Well, before I left, the nurse returned and said that my PCP is not taking new patients for intake appointments and that I'd have to see someone else. I wasn't sure if this would affect my insurance, so I asked about it, but I said it seemed like it would be okay. Then she said, ""Well, let me just check on it with Mailo [the PCP] on Monday, and I will call you back."" And I replied, ""Maybe we should just make an appointment now, and then you can call me if there's something that will change."" Then she said, (literally), ""No, I promise, promise, promise I will call you on Monday."" So basically, I went through a whole examination and talked to three different people about making an appointment, but STILL nobody set an appointment for me - WHICH WAS THE REASON I WENT IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. The nurse did not call me on Monday as promised, so I still do not have an appointment. If I call their number, I will not get the actual location, but an appointment line with some random person. So who knows if I will even hear back. REALLY? I mean, REALLY? They were perfectly nice while doing all of this. What good is that if they won't even set an appointment? Also, I was told I have arthritis, then given a prescription for naproxen. Why bother writing a prescription for naproxen when you could just say ""buy some naproxen""?

If there was every an indicator about the quality of what was to follow, the perfect fried calamari appetizer would be it...and it was perfect in every way, which surely isn't common in my experience. The fried shrimp, grilled artichokes, and antipasto appetizers all echoed the calamari: great quality and perfectly prepared.

As for the main courses, the blackened ribeye was magnificent: perfectly charred on the outside, tender and medium rare on the inside, and impeccably seasoned (I despise the salty bitterness that I've experienced with this dish in so many other restaurants).

Next up was a Chicken under a Brick. All I'm gonna say is this: make sure at least one person in your party orders this dish! I guarantee after all of the ooh's and ahh's you hear coming from that person's direction, you'll be ordering it on your next visit too. It was outstanding. 

As for the space itself...contemporary and inviting. The small, semi-private dining area in the rear is where you wanna be if you have a large party. 

I read some of the other Yelp reviews, and I recognize that even the best restaurants can screw up a dish on occasion - this one included - particularly when they're pushing things out of the kitchen on a busy night (the place was packed)! But that didn't happen to me. My overall dining experience was exemplary. My only criticism was there wasn't any room in my stomach for dessert.

Seated in the private (semi-private) room, we started with appetizer pastries (that's what I'll call them).  They ranged from sticky buns, to cinnamon buns, scones, and croissants among others.  Each one was absolutely wonderful.  Chef Blinn shows his skill with these pastries.  

Following this, we had our savory dishes which included shrimp and grits, Citrus and crab salad, Ciabatta Caprese, crustless quiche of the day, short rib fries, Croque monsieur panini, and chorizo Shepherd's pie.  I didn't get a chance to try the citrus and crab salad but everything else was outstanding.  I enjoyed the panini and the Ciabatta Caprese as well as the quiche.  Everything is thought out so well and they're very good dishes.

After the main dishes, it was time for more pastries that I'll refer to as dessert pastries.  These included mango sticky rice, S'mores waffles, a chocolate sticky bun, and a duo of bread pudding and sticky toffee pudding.

Service was excellent with new share plates and silverware for each course without needing to ask.  Refills of my iced tea were frequent and again with no need to ask.

Chef Blinn's desire to turn out quality pastries and savory dishes is evident in everything I tried.  He's a very dedicated man who makes his food with quality ingredients and has a menu that is very diverse such that anyone coming here can find many things to like.  You're not going away disappointed.

I have had nothing but issues with the vehicle since the week I bought it. I have taken it back to the dealership over and over - I initally purcahsed it from East Valley Nissan. They kept giving it back and saying ""that is just a common Nissan issue"" with no resolve OR it would sound WORSE!!! I then decided to go to a different dealership (AutoNation Tempe) with hopes of some sort of resolve. Instead it was the same amount of disappointment. When I arrived, I was bounced between 3 service agents before the final that took my keys. I told him the issues I was having as well as needing an oil change. He said ""Okay we will check it out and give you a call with what we find"" I told him I had an appointment in a couple of hours and he said no problem we should know by then. I then took the shuttle home as I only lived 3 miles away and had plenty to do during those couple of hours. 3 hours came and went and I still heard nothing back - starting to get nervous. I then call 3 TIMES and no answer from the service dept. I then called the sales dept and they said they'd have somebody call back. No call back within 30 mins. I call again and insist that sales not hang up and transfer me to service dept. The service rep then tells me they THINK they know the issue. They have started the repairs and it will be about another 3-4 hours!!!!! I reiterate I was supposed to get a call first as I had appointments in the afternoon. He kinda stutters and apologizes and says he knew I had been having issues and just wanted to get it done. I then had to cancel all appointments. I return and they just show me paperwork say it is covered under warranty as he rushes me through and not fully answering my questions. I then finally leave and as I am pulling out of the dealership. I hear ONE of the noises he said they were repairing. It was minor so I didn't think much of it. About a week later, it starts making a MUCH louder noise that sounds like the front end is going to come apart at any second!

We were in town for a company convention, and trying to arrange for a team dinner seemed impossible but through the amazing help of KC, Ryan and Kate, we were able to set up a team luncheon for 120 people and it went flawless! Kate was able to create a menu that fit within our budget, the food was great, came out fresh and on time. We blocked out the entire restaurant so we had access to the stage and microphone and that was the cherry on top!

We were only expecting 60-80 people at first. But about  2 hours prior to the lunch I notified Kate and she was quick to respond and work with the kitchen with our new numbers. The restaurant doesnt usually open till 3pm, but the crew was able to get some staff to come in early to serve us, so I have to commend the girls that ran the floor, because they  were able to keep up with the crowd, was very attentive to each guest and still had a smile at the end!

We usually have a convention in Phoenix once a year, so I definitely know where my to-go place is. Thanks team, you guys were awesome.

Aside from our team luncheon, this place is just great. Awesome vibe, their renovation is impeccable, the beers on tap has a huge variety, clean, big space and you can try to get tickets to the Stand Up Live comedy shows next door. The food is great as well.",0,0,0

First, this was for electric services.  I had two exterior outlets which were not working.  Lady on the phone told me there was a small $49 service fee which can be credited to work completed.  OK.  Shane comes out, spends an hour trying to determine the issue, doesn't know for sure but believes a connection was never made to service the front two outlets when the home was originally built in 2015 (I'm the second owner).  Then asks for $215 for the diagnostic.  What happened to the $49?  Oh, there's another $166 for a ""troubleshoot fee"".  Wasn't disclosed.  So $49 gets you to my house and then if I want to know what's wrong, I have to pay more?  Shady tactic.

Then Shane tells me it'll be $350 for the repair which will require 12 holes in my wall to run a new line from the circuit breaker through my garage.  Can't do it same day because he doesn't have spackle to close up the holes.

Next day comes back and had an ""epiphany"" overnight that he wouldn't need to run a new line, he could connect through another room.  Job which would have taken considerable amount of time now suddenly takes about an hour.

It is expensive. I felt a bit uncomfortable in my jeans and sweatshirt, but it was COLD outside, okay? (January, negative 15, snowing, wind chill. You know... Toronto.) And I didn't realize how upscale this place was. However, the staff never batted an eye about it, and graciously seated our chilled party of three. 

The place was not busy when we went, but perhaps that was because it was such horrible weather outside. The staff was attentive, friendly, and helpful. 

We immediately were served complimentary bread, with olive oil to accompany it. The olive oil was delicious. The different kinds of bread were delicious. (One a thin, crunchy toast, one a wheat bread, and the last a corn bread.) I couldn't stop eating it despite wanting to save room for what I knew would be coming.

We received a complimentary dish of fresh cheese, with honey and balsamic reduction. It was a lovely start. Very fresh. I could've eaten that all day. Yum! 

Our table shared an appetizer of raw, lightly marinated grouper with white asparagus. This was DIVINE. The pairing of flavours was fresh, harmonious, and unexpected. Again: that was something I could happily eat all day long. Wow. 

(I kept eating the bread with olive oil throughout all of this, and simply could not find the force of will to stop. It was so delicious. When I was done with the bread--I tried to be inconspicuous about it, I promise--I drank my remaining olive oil. If you tasted it, you would forgive me, I think.) 

I ordered the salted cod main course. My partner ordered the skate. The third of our table ordered the tilefish, which was one of the special fish dishes of the day. We shared to compare notes. All were amazing, we agreed, but the skate took the prize. 

The salted cod is a traditional Portuguese dish, I was informed. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and all of the components were phenomenally prepared, thought out, and cooked. I  am not sure about all of the ingredients, but I think there was beet, some almonds (I think), potato, kale, and asparagus.

We ordered a $70 bottle of white wine. I cannot remember what it was. I'm not a wine person--sorry--but this wine was very drinkable. 

The tawny 30-year-old port wine was incredible. It smelled so strongly like maple syrup and a bunch of other heavenly, complex things and it delivered all of that and more in the taste.

When I moved to Champaign a couple of years ago, I was extremely disappointed that there were no good Vietnamese places in Champaign-Urbana.  There's Saigon down in Savoy, but if you take the bus or bike everywhere (like I do) it's a little too far away.

Which brings us to Xinh Xinh.  The menu is small, composed primarily of appetizers, banh mi (vietnamese sandwiches), and pho (beef broth soup); however, here it's all about the quality, not the quantity.  I've been to plenty of restaurants with bloated menus that only have one or two things I want to try.  I think I've tried most of the menu at Xinh Xinh, and I've enjoyed all of it.

Also, the owner is very interested in his customers' opinions and will probably come ask you how things are going at some point during your meal.  He's extremely accommodating to various diets (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), so if you have a specific need, just ask him, and he'll do his best to work it out for you.

To break it down: the place has a nice, modern atmosphere; the owner is a great guy and comes out to get feedback from customers all the time; and the food is a delicious combination of traditional vietnamese flavors with some slight variations (i.e. the fried egg roll wrapper in the fresh spring rolls).  Just give it a try sometime, and I promise you'll want to go back for more.

One quick note: Xinh Xinh is cash only, so save yourself some trouble and make sure you have cash on hand when you go.  Trust me - it seems like a very small inconvenience once you try the food.",1,0,0

But first, an explanation.  I want to ask you to take a quick peek at Tabitha P's review, the sole non-five-star review here.  (Even the two filtered reviews are five star.)  Methinks perhaps Tabitha was in a bit of a hurry.  Her wine wasn't placed into her hand as swiftly as she preferred.  Or, to go all Area 51 conspiracy theory, she may not even exist.  Or she is a competitor.  One review, no friends.  Usually those get filtered; perhaps hers is destined for a similar fate.

Pretty rare that a retailer of any stripe receives nothing but five star reviews, yet Regency (if you pretend, as I do, that Tabitha's doesn't exist) goes full boat.  And that is entirely deserved.  Knowledge, humor, perhaps even a gentle touch with the customer is all in evidence.  So rare.  So appreciated.  Stop in, let me know if I'm right, or if Tabitha's right.  (Sure.  Like THAT'S a possibility.)

The numerous mistakes for an attraction we paid $80 for ruined our experience and provided us with the wrong certificates, photos etc. when your equipment failed. I would have gladly paid for the right photos, certificates and ID cards.

Today was our last full day visiting my son so when they encouraged a review, I was certain I was going to have an epic adventure with both of my kids. I'm sorry this won't be the case. 

We got there at 3:30, posted our excitement, took our selfies, got pictures of my kids together (which only happens a couple times a year now) while we waited and when we went into the training I was feeling fabulous. 

Shortly after entering the first room, my training device popped up with a low battery. We were alone with no employees so I finished the section and sat on the floor to wait for the doors to open with the next group while my 21 and 10 year old carried on. I waited as they got an introduction our group hadn't gotten and approached the new guide about the battery. 

I had already taken excited photos upstairs before and some other pictures and she confirmed they would need to get me a new set. My kids were already done in the other room waiting. I was upset about the loss of the pictures and experiencing it with them.  

The nice young lady who had just come in for the night shift said the devices should have been charged and seeing my upset contacted the manager Cassandra who brought a new device and assured me I would get my original pictures and told me our photos would be comped.

So, took the new device and quickly caught up. Cassandra gave me a paper connected to the dead device and told me to make sure I kept it and gave it to the photo counter at the end.

Just as we got to Iron Man, my son's battery died and I got a new ""low battery"" warning. He didn't finish anything Iron man and par for the course, the game there was ""not calibrating correctly"". The lady in debriefing plugged my son's into a charger so he could finish debriefing with all of his photos intact. 

At 5:45 we had been there two hours. So we went to the photo counter like we were told with all four papers. The three people at the counter didn't know what we were talking about but a new male manager confirmed what Cassandra said. 

They said they could only do one collage for each device and put up previews of the photos on the screen. The first photos were there and so were his. Thankfully I took pictures of the screen. We left with a bag of our pictures etc and went to look for somewhere to eat. 

I told them to wait until we were sitting at a table so we didn't immediately view the folders. When we did, mine had only the photos from my second device, the certificate from the first device with one room completed and not I had completed. My son's didn't have his pictures but a copy of the collage I got from my second device. His pictures and the pictures I had wanted were gone. 

We ran back to the photo counter after we ate to hopefully get them but the man at the counter told me that they couldn't have pulled those pictures once the batteries died. But I had a certificate for the first device. He called the manager on the walkie ""the same problem from before"" and he said he was too busy.  

The first woman who initially helped me went down to tell him the papers had the photos. He told her the devices were wiped and the pictures were gone. She offered to let us go back through but we couldn't. My son had to go home. 

All in all, it was not epic. From devices with low batteries, getting timely help, to the uninformed photo counter...my last event with my son before we leave was problem after problem. Positives - my daughter's was right, the photos and ID cards were free but I would have been happy to pay for everything being right instead.

I was at least relieved to remember I had taken pictures of the screens, with the photos the guy said they could never have had. They had made a great collage. My completed certificate would have been nice to have gotten too...we kinda worked for those points.

I think if everyone had the work ethic the night tour guide had or Cassandra the manager, all of that might not have happened and this would be a 5 star review.",2,0,0

It appeared that the driver was having a hard time keeping the bus moving in a straight line. We weren't veering from lane to lane, but from one side of our lane to the other, back and forth. Going around some corners was not smoothly navigated, but jerky and scary like we were going over the cliff or at least into the guardrail. We couldn't tell if this was caused by a mechanical problem with the bus that the driver was having to fight, or whether it was lack of skill or capacity on the part of the driver (who told us he was born in 1937, which would have made him 79 or 80 years old -- and many of us were shocked that people can legally be licensed and hired to take the lives of 50 people into their hands at that age). To top it off, the driver wouldn't stop talking on the PA -- not just about the countryside and history (which would have been fine) but about his personal life, famous people he had met, and his political views (attacking the president, which might have been fine if the bus was full of Democrats who would have enjoyed it, but the passengers this time were politically diverse and many were offended). We all dreaded knowing that we were going to have the same driver on the way back to Mesquite. The driving on the way back was worse, but at least the talking stopped! The best thing I can say is ""we survived"".",0,0,0

The shop owner offers a better price on repairs for cash money payments but you have to push for a receipt for them. Add in to that, if you pick up your car after 3:30pm, everyone's drinking beer on the shop floor. 

To add to the utter sketchiness, I also apparently paid for several repairs ($$$) that another repair shop is now telling me were not made.

However, I thought I'd marinate on it for a day.  Well, the queasiness has not subsided and here I am, a day later, to tell anyone who will listen that this place is TERRIBLE.

I'd looked at their menu online before leaving and noticed that they had a tuna salad wrap on the menu.  When I got there, the tuna salad was only available on a salad.  I asked the waitress if I could get it on bread instead, and she stared blankly at me before replying ""well, we have a tuna melt.""  I asked her if the tuna on the tuna melt was indeed the tuna salad, and she said no.  Apparently the tuna salad is not available any other way but on lettuce.  So, I ordered the tuna melt cold.  

When it came, it was disgusting.  It was literally tuna straight out of a can (no mayonnaise) with a couple capers sprinkled on top.  There was way too much bread which was dry and gross.  I asked the waitress for some mayonnaise, which it took her over five minutes to get (meanwhile, she cleared dishes and completed other tasks).  I did eventually get a blob of mayonnaise in a Dixie cup, but when I tried to mix it in with the tuna the whole sandwich fell apart.  I ended up trying to eat some of it with my fork and foregoing the bread altogether, but at this point I was so grossed out I and irritated with Carly's that I didn't eat much.

Also, my friend ordered a hot sandwich that was supposed to come with peppers, but did not.  He pointed this out to the waitress and she returned several minutes later with a few refrigerated peppers on a plate.  He asked another waitress if she could bring him some warm peppers to go with his warm sandwich, which she did after several minutes.  Coincidentally(?), he started feeling sick shortly after and had to miss work today.

When the bill came, the oh-so-helpful waitress had charged me extra for the mayonnaise.  Needless to say, I won't be going back there.  If you are in the mood for a sandwich downtown, there are a million better places where the servers are actually decent.  Some suggestions: Cibo, the Main Ingredient Alehouse, and Old Station.  Even Subway has amazing service and gourmet food compared to Carly's.",10,2,3

Our main reason for going here was that every other place on the North Shore had long waits and although we could have traveled to another nearby area, we figured that the food had to be at least something worthwhile given this was a sit down restaurant with a full menu. Some would say that a short wait for a table would warrant a good rating, but since every other place had a huge wait, that is really not a good aspect by comparison. It's kinda like saying ""Wow you're so luck you don't have to listen to Katy Perry sing!"" to a deaf person.

The food was really bland, boring and nothing special. Boring food is OK if you're not paying a lot at a drive thru or you make it at home with no culinary skills, but a sit down restaurant should actually have something to it for taste. As for drinks, two of the four of us had alcohol. My sister-in-law's Long Island was injected with more liquor than Billy Joel on a drive home. My ""Lynchburg Lemonade"" tasted like nothing. It was almost just a flat soda, though I'd be willing to wager that I could drink actual flat soda and get more wasted.

While our server was nice, she was barely existent (I believe most of them hang out with the bartenders and forget they have tables . . . and possibly standards). I had an easier time believing Denise Richards as a Nuclear Physicist in that Bond movie than I did believing that the women here were waitresses.

If the food had some substance and quality to it, I don't think this would be a horrible place to go. I just don't see spending the money on bland food and drinks. Since I have to give it at least one star, I'd justify it with the fact that they do make the male workers wear kilts (so kudos on consistency for them) and because we had fun making lots of ""Tilted Klit"" jokes.",5,6,1

The place was filled when we came in to order takeout.  I opted for the roasted lamb dinner and my partner, the chicken souvlaki dinner. Not wanting the starch heavy meal combos of potatoes AND rice, we inquired if we could substitute the potatoes and the rice for side salad instead. 

We are told that we can do this for a charge of four dollars each. Hmmmm. We don't want the potatoes or rice and are charged for that in the cost of the dinner 'combo' but have to pay an extra four dollars apiece for salad. Worth mentioning is that this 'salad' consists merely of chopped iceberg lettuce, slightly browning, red onion, equivalent of quarter tomato and one olive with a very seemingly hesitant sprinkling of feta atop. 

The food was ok.  Nothing remarkable. We won't return as $54 dollars was ridiculous for the amount\/quality of food we received.",5,2,1

We ordered a pie with extra cheese and it came home to us overcooked.
The crust is way too bready and although we didn't think it was the greatest pie the first time we ordered one, it did not taste like the one we recently ordered.  They'll know exactly who we are on this review.  It tasted like the cook threw the hot sauce from the wings all over the pie.  Although we had also ordered a dozen hot wings, we had not tried them yet but when we did (after we called to report the problems), the pie was hotter\/spicier than the wings.  The manager said well, our sauce does have some hot pepper in it (WTH), I ordered a cheese pizza.  They would only offer us another pie (no thanks, I'm not liking the one I have) or half of the money back and all kinds of hoops until finally he agreed ONLY if we brought back the pie to refund our payment which we promptly got back in the car and returned it.  The wings were average and the pie is NOT pizza like we know it from NY or  NJ where we were born and raised.  A cheese pizza does not burn your throat or tongue when you eat it because it has hot pepper sauce and it should not come to you with brown spots all over it from being over cooked or too close to the fire!

- I ordered a pint of Boddington's (draught) which should have been $8. When the bill came it was $11. I asked the server why it was $11 and he said because it was a 20 oz. I am still trying to figure out how they squeezed 20 oz's of Boddington's into a pint glass. Hmmm....

- My wife ordered a diet Pepsi and it was $4. Wow! 

- I ordered the Chicken Curry. It took about 25 minutes to come out and when it arrived the portion wasn't the biggest, the sauce was good, the rice was fine, but the chicken was undercooked (pink). Definitely not worth the $24 price tag.

xvUMkpGLbn_JLxmJYlcLtA,vAVbviOmnTlG0_0UbdnaPA,NgnutumJwK_X3HSIvtrkQw,1,2015-09-02,"Where to begin on a highly negative review about a pool re-do by this company? For 10 months I have waited for the main problem, a problem this company was the cause of, to be rectified, to no avail. I can only guess Dan is waiting two more months for the warranty to be over so he is not accountable for his mistake. This months call was unanswered. Synopsis~ DO NOT use this man for a pool renovation. He is a pool guy for pool maintenance only. He did well when he fixed our pool pump. Not so much for a simple pool renovation. He has no crew or techs relying on him for reputation. He is a very expensive and unnecessary middle man. He hires a crew to do the work and then leaves the customer to oversee the project. I REGRET deciding to hire him.

All I have wanted and STILL want is the leveler to work! A leveler I did not even want. A leveler that was added at his cost and the crews labor because he was not overseeing this renovation. Over a month to complete, I do not lie when I say he showed up TWO times only, until final bill day. An abandoned line was not only not sealed, but perfectly mini pebbled around. To add insult to incompetence, Dan was handing me a final bill while a drain cover was being screwed on to ""hide"" the mistake. See pictures. You will see my hand and a totally USELESS hole with a drain cover on it (before the leveler was added) as the water was filling up to further ""hide"" the mistake!

How did a hole like that get forgotten? Honest mistake you can think. But you see, a big deal was made of that area. It was an old line only 2' from the filter. A new designated vacuum line was desired and hope was to be put right there. But no, Dan stated there was fear of the crew digging in that area and hitting electrical lines of the pool light. We wanted no safety hazard so as suggested we agreed to the new line, at a costly fee of digging and re-plumbing 20' on the other side of the pool. Somehow the crew forgot that danger, thought the hole had purpose and left it, as they perfectly plastered around the useless hole of danger. Later when demanded to fix, they had to dig in that area anyways for their solution of making the useless hole, useful~ a water leveler. I flat out refused to have a mini pebble ""patch"" on a brand spanking new mini pebble plastered pool. It was admitted that a patch would show. 

I say that about the crew in jest. Among a communication barrier, they honestly tried as hard as they could with what was thrown at them. The customer pointing out mistakes and the biggest problem, being the absent Dan, the guy hired to do the job! Everything I relayed to him upon our planning discussion literally had to be re-communicated to the crew at each step. I kid you not when I say, he would call to tell what to tell them! Unprofessional!

So now what I have is the first useless hole in the side of the pool and a useless hole outside the pool for the leveler that levels the pool water if you shoot hose water through it to start it. Then it doesn't work until you do that again. Four times Dan or the crew came out and that is what they did, blew water through it and it worked that day. As the water evaporates, it has never turned on again on its own since 11\/11\/14. Pics, emails & video has been sent to Dan to show that it is not functioning with out that kick start. Imagine buying a new car and you have to get a jump to start it every time. Would that be acceptable? This situation is not acceptable. Dan said he wanted me to be happy when I looked at my pool. It was lip service because I am still not happy and he will not honor the warranty (as I throw my hose in to fill the pool right next to the non functioning water leveler). I have been very patient. At this point I am pissed, two months away from the one year warranty expiring, wondering if legal action is my only avenue.

So since I have to waste my time writing this review I think it pertinent to add more mistakes for you to consider if you consider hiring this company and as I said, I lay blame on Dan's shoulders for not being present as HE was hired to do the job ...

-Be clear on what grout you want. My mistake maybe, I assumed the grout would be white to blend in nicely with the light blue plaster. It is literally cement grey. Cement, as in used my skimmer basket to strain the rocks from cement and used as grout. The white water line shines brightly against the grey cement grout.
-Later mentioned I need a skimmer basket as I don't have one. When pointed out what mine was used for and where I seen it last in the garbage pile, a new one magically appeared.
-Another dead line, an abandoned aerator line, was also forgotten to be sealed and covered to the point of being PERFECTLY tiled around. Was fixed. And by now crew and customer is super frustrated and tense. Dan? Nowhere to be seen.
Oh there is more! But there is a cap for writing on here (see pics). I hope to come back and say he fixed the problem! Doubt it after this review.",10,0,1

After talking to the representative we were told that we were not eligible to use the edge program due to not having six months of good payments. We had five months of good payments, the only break within our multi year contract of good payments, where we had auto payments, was one month where we had fraud on our account and the Verizon wireless back office told us not to make our payment so they could fix the fraud on our account that they had allowed to happen. A week later I decided to call the back office in hopes that they could put a remark on my account ""saying that it was okay for myself and my wife to use the edge program because the problem with our billing was due to fraud."" Verizon wireless's back-office put me on hold well they called my local store. After about 20 minutes of being on hold the back office person told me that the store cannot do anything and back office cannot do anything and the only choice that I have is to call a third person and go through a long process with them and ""maybe"" they can help me. I can except the fact that even though after being a Verizon wireless customer for over 10 years, they are over charging me for every thing and I'm losing my unlimited data plan, the one thing that I cannot except and will not forget is they are denying me privileges and services they give to every one else because I had a lapse in payment due to an error they made. I am being punished because they could not keep their website secure and when I called to try and fix it they pretty much told me ""sucks to be you, nothing I can do about it."" It took me over two months to fix this fraud on my account where Verizon Wireless allowed someone to run up almost $2000 in charges on a phone line, they talked me into, that does not even work. Now I am being denied services that are given to everyone else due to one month of bad payments, that they told me not to pay because it was their fault. All I wanted to do was upgrade my wife and my phone and continue on with verizon, regardless of the issues we have had. Now I am looking into a completely new carrier because I'm tired of Verizon wireless treating my family like we don't matter. I tried to accept that stuff happens and did not get mad about the fraud, even though it took over 6 phone calls to fix, but the way I am being treated now by individual stores and corporate as a whole is unforgivable. I used to love verizon and I told all my friends to join. Now I'm thinking of changing and hoping my friends do to.",3,0,0

The location near 12th St and Indian School (near the 99 cent Store and Mo Pawn) might throw you, but don't let it... take this excursion to deliciousness and you will be back. Our group of 4 ordered 4 different dishes and were all happy. The Amok Fish (Tilapia in a savory curry coconut sauce, served over spinach in a folded banana leaf) was superb. The accompanying side of Melon Soup was quite flavorful. The Spring Rolls are very like what you'd get in any good Vietnamese restaurant but still a ""must munch"", startling texture contrasts with shrimp, chicken and crisp veggies in a sticky chewy rice wrapper, light and refreshing with the little ramekin of fish sauce. After your meal, splurge on the Iced Coffee... OMG! I hated cold coffee until I tried this. Now I'm an addict.

We ended up in Vegas for New Years so i got tickets for my hubby and I as a lil Christmas Present.
Criss Angel sucks...you can tell half the time what's going on with the tricks. The magic tricks aren't that great and he is so egocentric it make me want to puke. It was crazy how many times he said his own name!
 
The only redeeming factor was the Cirque aspect, as always they are great.

Though I imagine people thinking this would be family friendly but it's very dark. I would be terrified if I was a kid with the costumes and things they do. I Definitely don't recommend it much less to bring kids too.

What made me feel very uneasy is that although I told the guy (the owner?), that it's a to-go, he came out of the kitchen and asked me if we are going to eat it now or later. I said later, thinking it was because he wanted to know if to wrap it in aluminum foil or something. 
Well.. it wasn't wrapped in foil. but now I felt like they intentionally gave me the fat from the end piece knowing I will be far gone by the time I realize it.

I have totally grey hair, which I have been recently coloring an auburn color, with a good amount of red. The last time I went to my regular stylist, I asked her to tone down and get rid of the red so I can move back to a rich, dark brown. I understand red is hard to get rid of; but she gave me the exact same color.

Enter Jennifer at Hair ColorXperts. I made my appointment this week, letting them know my current hair and my expectations. I went in today and talked about my options with Jennifer, she was very thorough and made sure to cover all of the challenges with my hair (resistant grey, lots of brassy red, etc.). We settled on a dark brown with warm lights, as that red won't go away until I cut it off.  :)

My result was amazing - it's a dark, very rich brown with very subtle red - she really toned down the red to the maximum, which is exactly what I wanted. After my color, she did my cut, and then started to blow dry. Not happy with the shade, she gave me another glaze for my ends. This really made a significant difference and I've never had a stylist go the extra mile like this to make sure the color was right.

I am incredibly happy with my new color, the color is fantastic and it's so shiny and soft. I 100% recommend Jennifer to any of my friends and family. Her knowledge of color is amazing. She works closely with you to ensure she is giving you exactly what you want!

See you in the fall, Jennifer!!  :)",0,0,0

My fiance and I lived here for one year, and had no complaints about the community during our first 10 months or so. When Pinnacle came in, took over, and the name changed to Biltmore at Camelback, everything went down hill. I can't even keep track of how many staff turned over in the last 8 or so weeks of our lease. Clearly, there was an issue with management, whether at the property or corporate level, and they couldn't keep a similar face in house. Which probably explains all of the issues we've experienced with the leasing consultants since 30 days prior to our move out, and now 30 days since our move out. 

We received misinformation from various leasing consultants, including one who miscalculated our final rent amount due, and now we're being held responsible for a balance that we were told by the consultant was ZERO prior to move out. Seriously!? The Biltmore at Camelback staff doesn't back up their consultants, and come to find out the one who helped us is no longer with the company, so they can't help us because ""she didn't leave any notes"". Unbelieveable. I'm still searching for my copy of what she calculated...although 30 days after a move to a new place, not sure if I'll find it. Shouldn't be our responsibility anyway. 

We've heard several similar complaints from friends in the community who have also since moved out. With all the turnover in that office, leasing agents are bound to make mistakes, leave behind messes (with no intention of cleaning them up), and don't expect to be helped by anyone in the office. This place is such a mess. 

I wouldn't recommend this community to anyone. You'll spend more time dealing with an unhelpful office staff than you will enjoying the community. Not worth the headache.",6,0,0

I have been having issue after issue with Cox. First, I was without internet for 2 months and I was in communication with Cox a majority of that time. When I got a tech out, he confirmed that I did not have internet, and that I would not have been able to have it because none of the electrical outlets were working. 

When I contacted Cox to ask about a refund for the 2 months I didn't have internet, they said they could credit me 1\/2 a month! Wow...and they also charged me $75.00 for the tech coming out, which I was never told about. When I had chatted with their online help, their agent offered me a tech visit and did not once mention there was even a possibility for a fee.

I've had 2 awful experiences with Lyft that have convinced me they don't really screen their drivers, and they don't believe in ""customer is always right"". One experience, the male driver sexually harassed me while I was sitting in the front seat. He kept touching my leg (even asked if He could rub my feet) and asked if I would have lunch with him after dropping me off. Let me point out, Uber is quick to give you ride credits the minute they find out you had an unpleasant ride. I reported this traumatizing incident to Lyft, and all they replied with was a short ""sorry"" e-mail. No nothing! Not even an assurance that they will look into that particular driver. He is dangerous!

The next ride, the driver repeatedly told me he could spare me 5 minutes on my way to my real destination, for me to run in real quick and grab something. I had left my belongings in his car. As soon as I was out of sight, he ended the trip and drove off with my things. He never responded to my Lost & Found report. I had to go out of my way and try to contact Lyft directly (which is impossible via phone), only to have them come back at me with ""the driver claims he left your items on the street before leaving"" and ""we are not responsible for items left by passengers"". No nothing again.

Lyft sided with the driver on this one. I tried to explain the messed up logic they're refusing to remedy: The driver had full knowledge and consented repeatedly to wait for me. He had my things in his car. ENDED THE TRIP without my knowledge. Blatantly disregarded the safety of my items, did not even bother to try to let me know he could not wait anymore (because I honestly didn't care if he could not wait, I would've called another Lyft or Uber, ""reportedly left my items on the street"", ended the trip without me knowing (which is against Lyft policy, I know this), and drove off.

First time Lyft asked him about it, he said he didn't have my items. Second time, he then says he actually left them on the street before leaving. He's clearly lying out of his butt to save face with Lyft! Also, just his disregard for policies and customers' property can be used as reasons to at least suspend his driving account on Lyft! This guy is still driving around, without suffering any repercussions, and I have no way to get my things back. I was not even compensated. No ride credits, no proper apology, no assurance that they are taking steps to look into this driver. LYFT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ITS CUSTOMERS.",10,5,1

We were told our dog would be ready by 9:30 & they would call us. It is now 10:42 and we still have no dog. It took us driving down there to be told his surgery had not started and now would not be done until midnight. The receptionist could have easily diffused the situation by apologizing and telling us another emergency had come through so that was why our dog was not seen yet. She could have also apologized for not contacting us to inform us of that. We were met with silence and a blank stare by the receptionist.

Als große Fans der thailändischen Küche besuchten wir gestern Abend das Thai Thaani Restaurant. Beim Betreten des Restaurants wurden wir freundlich begrüßt und an unseren reservierten Tisch gebracht. Das Restaurant war zu dieser Zeit (20:00 Uhr) sehr gut besucht, was ja häufig ein Indikator für gute und konstante Küche ist.

Bedienung
Die Servicekräfte waren allesamt sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Ihr Lächeln wirkte ehrlich und authentisch, was zu unserem Wohlbefinden beigetragen hat.
Das Essen
Wir bestellten diverse Suppen zur Vorspeise und Currys zur Hauptspeise. Die Speisekarte ist wie in den meisten asiatischen Restaurants sehr umfangreich. Pro Fleisch-\/ und Fischsorte wurden ca. 8-10 diverse Gerichte angeboten. Die Wartezeit war für die Restaurantauslastung in Ordnung.
Die Vorspeisen (Tom Yam Gung\/Tom Yam Gai) waren äußerst lecker und mit frischen Zutaten hergestellt. Dies ist für den Preis von 5-6 Euro allerdings auch zu erwarten.
Als Hauptspeise bestellte ich mein Lieblingsgericht und Thai-Klassiker (Ente auf rotem Curry mit Ananas, Litschees und Cherrytomaten), welches ich zu Hause mitilfe David Thompsons Thai-Food Kochbuch bereits mehrfach zubereitet habe und auch in diversen thailändischen Restaurants versuchte.Der Geschmack und die Aromen der Speise war unübertrieben himmlisch! Frische und Vollmundigkeit waren umwerfend und ich wollte gar nicht aufhören zu essen. Hier habe ich mir einige Ideen für meine eigene Zubereitung holen können und würde es am liebsten sofort nachkochen. Die zweite Person bestellte dasselbe und war ebenfalls begeistert.
Die dritte Person bestellte ein Cashew-Hühnchen-Gericht und war auch sehr zufrieden.
Tolle Küche!!!
Das Ambiente
Der Gastraum wirkte urig, auf den ersten Blick zwar etwas klein, was es allerdings sehr gemütlich machte. Die Gestaltung ist liebevoll und typisch thailändisch sehr farbenfroh.
Sauberkeit
Der Gastraum\/Tisch war sauber. Die Toilette habe ich allerdings nicht aufgesucht.",0,0,0

I use to pay for a family of four around 35 to 40 dollars.  Today paid almost $60.  They said they increased their sizes of their rolls which it was, but it's really not worth the extra $5 you pay for each roll and dish.  The waitress said they still have rolls from the previous menu but that as well the price increases by $1.50 to $2.00 for some dishes.   I recommend taking your sushi fix across the street from Hosu to Sushi Time  if you're looking for better quality sushi for the price range.",1,0,0

Not only was Nicole attentive with my wants\/dislikes but she did exactly what I asked and an overall awesome job on my Knight!!

Also I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner Jackie as well which was awesome because you could tell she loves what's she does and it automatically made me feel comfortable leaving my fur child there.

I had a primary mortgage and my second was sold to PNC.  Unfortunately, due to financial hardship, I had to short sell my house.  That's when the nightmare began.  PNC will not allow me to sell the property unless I agreed to pay the remaining balance, which was about $33K.  I ended up signing the paperwork agreeing to it just so I don't lose the buyer.  Never mind the fact I had paid $10K in advance three years ago, thinking I was going to keep my home.  PNC was unwilling to work with me to settle the final balance of $33K, which was not due until mid July of this year.

It's bad enough that PNC could care less about the fact that I made a large lump sum payment in advance 3 years ago.  The fact that they are unwilling to work with me when I'm in financial hardship just shows how heartless these people are.  If you see a PNC bank, run as fast as you can away from it!!!

Where to begin? The property is very nice! There is grass everywhere! You think yay! My dogs will love it!(Only place in Vegas that isn't just concrete).They aren't pet friendly but I have service dogs and there is even a little dog area! Yay! ...Or so you think...this is my second time staying at this hotel and every single time I am outside I'm approached and questioned by security. ""Why are you here? Can I help you with something? We aren't pet friendly? Welll idk if we accept service dogs (wtf). what room are you staying in? What's the last name? Show me your key? Like legit go away. I take my animals out all day long, walk around the property, exercise and what not. I understand once or twice being asked but like 4x a day I'm harassed and treated like I'm not a paying guest. This happened the entire 1st time I stayed here also.. how rude. If I walked around in ripped crack head clothes okay whatever, but that is FAR from the case.
...where my issue really starts. 
We checked in a few days ago. I had put this really classy cute sign on our door above the original do not disturb sign...my sign had said "" four legged guest in suite"" and had a picture of a dog and a cat...just informing anyone that their is an animal (2) in the room, most hotels supply these signs to their guests...incase of emergency, to inform housekeeping, anything....the insanely rude housekeeping manager lady approaches my boyfriend and I and says ""I don't like this sign"" those exact unprofessional words. And we tried to explain to her in Spanish and English that the sign was for the service animals. She completely disregarded us. Waving this plan ""do not disturb sign"" in our faces..""this sign only""..so we said okay left it at that put the sign on the door...
now days go by and we see her like easily 4x a day in the hallways, getting new towels and outside.
This is when it not only gets ""petty"" but confusing. Not confusing because I am stupid, but confusing because we were picked on and bullied. It's like 9:30 am and we are outside with our dogs and security approaches us with all the lame questions like stated before and he's like ohhh you are in room blaaahhh and we are like yes...he then explains to us that the house keeping manager requested a Wellfare check on our room because we had the do not disturb sign on the door for 4 days.. mind you we were forced to put the sign on the door...we have also seen this housekeeping manager that requested the check up like 4x already that day....it's not even 10am.sooo thennnnn everyone is mad at us because we have service animals...they were checked in at the front they both have ids, documents, everything!! So now we have to fight that and then the hotel checks our reservation and notices we checked them in (each time we have been here)...okay fine that's done...holy crap on a stick now they housekeeping needs to check our room to make sure it's fine and there are no damages ? (Excuse me wtf..) fine whatever..okay so that goes down..the evil Mexican person who started all our problems is now checking our room ...rolls eyes...she comes out in her Mexican voice ""ohhhhhh isssss okay""..duh. I'm hella clean of course my room isn't a mess...so once again yaaaay all finished!!! We are back outside with our dogs 20 mins later and security is all bum rushing to our building.oh effing great I think.we now go to our room and are told by all the security blocking our door that we are being evicted and must pack up...crazy right?! Evicted from a hotel that we obviously already paid for...
my other problems: that older male security guard is awful! He's way to threatening of a person. As a female he continued to be little and talk down to me. every time I would open my mouth to respond to him he would interrupt me and walk closer to me..creepy unacceptable. I pointed this out to him every time he wanted to discuss something (while I was being babysat & forced to pack all our stuff) anddd he continued to do it anyways...like so many times. It's not like he thought I was a threat..lit got to the point where he would speak over me so ignorantly and walk towards me that I would have to take steps back and close the door.. I am 5'5 120lbs always in pink.. I am in no way a threat to this full sized man and his back up. However the security chic he had with him was very sweet and she needs a new boss. She shouldn't be subjected to having to be around a man like that. The first time we stayed here we had housekeeping every other day, unfortunately during our last stay my make up bag and the contents of my bag were destroyed while house keeping was there.. my entire faces (pale and tan) of mac make up were crushed and destroyed. CRUSHED! Glass of foundation broken!

The story goes like this...they came to the house for something else but told my elderly mother that they noticed the water heater was not hooked up safely and didn't have a permit. They said it was probably done by a handyman...and yes, it was done by a handyman. Instead of hooking it up properly and getting a permit which they could've easily done...they decide to talk her into buying a 40 gallon water heater for close to $1400. They said ""it will run more efficiently"". At the time my mother was getting chemotherapy in CA so she had explained that no one is really home. Carmine had told her that it would be a better choice because there are only 2 people living in the house and would save her money.

One day we take a bath and there is no hot water for the entire house. I call Carmine and he says ""of course, you have a garden hose tub""...""you need a bigger water heater if you want more hot water"". Well, if you knew...why did you sell the small water heater?! We had a bigger water heater that still had many years left of warranty that was working properly when they sold the 40 gallon water heater to my mother.

We contacted the State Contractors Board and Number One Plumbing was told that they needed to install water heaters according to code which is the number of bathrooms in the house...NOT the number of people in the house. A 40 gallon water heater is for a small 2 bedroom apartment...my house is 2900 sq. ft. with 5 bedrooms and 3 full bathrooms.

We did not want their services anymore when they offered to come back. We spoke to the owner about getting our money back as well since they lied to my mother who didn't know a thing about water heaters. 

We ended up taking them to Small Claims and won a Judgement in our favor. However, Number One Plumbing did not respond to requests of payment or return any calls back even with a Judgement by the Court. Their lawyer contacted me that they will pay $899 out of a Judgement that was close to $2600. The lawyer wrote that Number One Plumbing had financial hardships...their net income was close to $1.8 million in 9 months when I did my research. It really makes you laugh when they charge outrageous prices and say they have hardships because information is readily available if you know where to look. In the end, I looked up who their bond company was and sent a letter to them requesting payment for the Judgement I had won. 

Their lawyers contacted me immediately and said they were ready to pay the full amount since they would have problems renewing their bond.

This company is dishonest and I would not recommend them to anyone. Use them if they are the only plumbers on the planet!",5,1,1

Last night, while staying at the Golden Nugget, we were robbed. It happened after we went to sleep, while we were in the room. Deadbolt you doors. Lesson learned! So scary!!!! The hotel staff were rude, not helpful and downright disgraceful. I assumed the security staff would call the police or know how to handle the incident. We wrote out a report and then later I found out they had not called the police. We were given no procedures or helpful advice. None! Funny thing was when I spoke with the desk manager in the morning, about the rudeness, he was more concerned that the charges for out room got posted to our cancelled credit card. Oh, he tried to say the right things all while making sure the payment was good., barely making eye contact. So disappointed,  I would NEVER have so little empathy for anyone. I did not ask for anything from them financially so it is not like they were trying to get out of something and all I got was nothing but condescending, begrudged assistance. 

I wanted to add an update, just after this review, I received a call from the Golden Nugget. The lady was very nice and apologized. After a long conversation where I explained that they should have a policy and some printed material for their guests should this happen to anyone else (i.e. What to do if they steal your I.D. and you have to get on a plane, etc.) she offered a refund and a free stay, which she was going to email (I guess she forgot to send it, apparently not important). 

I wonder, do they know what a toll this has taken on my husband and I? We no longer have a sense of safety. Sleeping is a nightmare! We have anger that because their security did not call the police, the robbers got away with our cash and wallets. Turns out that while security was in our room they were using my credit card to get a cab. If security had been doing their job, we might have had our possessions back. Also, we were on a private floor, there had to have been surveillance, something!  I feel that their lack of security caused this, and I have my suspicions it may have been an inside job, as my purse with no money or regular credit cards was taken, (makes me wonder who went through my stuff previously to know that) the failure of security to do anything, the access key to the private floor and our room, the rudeness management to try to make me feel somehow responsible (I was told at one point by management that they would probably find out we were robbed by our traveling companions, friends of ours for 20 plus years and 10 plus years) and then their pretense to listen, make changes to their policy but obviously an email was even too much! The reason for this update is that with each sleepless night it is impossible not to replay all of the insults in our heads. It takes our mind off of the fear that their lack of security has put there.",15,0,0

I went in and the front desk kid sent back to speak with David. He talked my ear off for like 45 minutes, showed me around the gym and then proceeded to badger me into signing up for a membership. I continuously told him that I was interested in using the week guest pass to determine if I'd like to join. He refused to listen to me and kept going on and on about it after I repeatedly told him no. Honestly, he gave me the creeps I felt like I was being forced into something. So then he proceeded to go and get his ""manager"" who did pretty much the same thing. At this point, I was furious after attempting to tell them BOTH I wanted to use guess pass for 1 week prior to signing up. Then I told them this was absurd and totally horrible customer service and I walked out. That high pressure stuff is SO ANNOYING!!!!! I feel bad for them that they have to have such a horrible job... They must piss people off all day long.

Anyways, if you go here expecting to do a trial run.... you probably won't be able to! Especially with that David guy. He was a creep!!! 

Side note: While he was showing me around the gym, we walked pass a Zumba class or something and a bigger girl was teaching the class. David said ""I don't know why she's teaching the class.... To each their own I guess."" 
He also assumed I wanted to lose weight (I'm skinny and in good shape). He was just annoying pushy guy. 

AVOID DAVID IF YOU CAN!!!!!

The cons: Security:  Lacking.  I've seen both the fire department and police department called out for my building alone in the last 2 months at least once a week.  Security at the complex is about as useful as a giving a drowning victim a glass of water.  

Hot water:  If you enjoy a hot shower in the morning, don't ever anticipate it here.  I have hot water if I wake up before 5 am.  No joke.  If I wait till 7 a.m. it's luke warm at best.  Of course, this is not the times when management informs us that the water will be turned off and normally only after it's been turned off. 

Noise levels:  Unbelievable.  I believe I have a heard of elephants above me.  The floors are the worse for noise reduction (or the lack thereof).  If you like hearing the trampling of the occupants above you, move here... music and other noises... Daily.  BOOM BOOM BOOM... I actually have pictures on the wall shake from the noise.  

BUGS.. yes, they have them.  ALL of them.  Cousins, aunts, uncles, siblings... the bugs are everywhere, ceilings, walls, and of course, the counters, cabinets etc.  I've hired a pest control guy and he couldn't keep up with the infestation.  He told me that the roaches are in the walls and come through the cracks of the apartments.  I've seen for myself the cockroaches leave via my ceiling to go terrify my neighbor above me.. or get trampled. I can't understand why the management will not do a major bug bomb, but it's probably too much money.  

Drugs:  If you like the occasional 'parfume viva la cannibus, by all means, you'll love it.  The walls are thin and obviously, if bugs can transport from one apartment to another, then smell does as well.  Renter beware. 


The neighborhood is great though for the vagrants, transients and homeless people that are continuously in the garbage bins.  Be nice to all of them.. they probably look out for the apartments more then the security group.  

Little kids are always running the parking lot.  I don't know why parents will let them outside to play in the parking lot when the apartments do have a swimming pool, and basketball court the kids could play in, but maybe the kids are just playing with the homeless vagrants and transients.  

Hope this helps the next poor soul... good luck.",10,3,1

First of all, he looked at my car and said SUV we need to charge 40 surcharge. I was like it's not first time I have car detailing, the surcharge is always 10$. He said its on their website, which is definitely not stated on groupon. And he just laughed and told me to go back to that cheap place. 

Then he looked inside and said they had to charge another 40 for salt removal and stain removal which is not covered in my groupon. The group on only covers shampooing. I was like fine, just shampoo, but can't you just simply vacuum it first? He said no, can't do it. And wouldn't do it without upgrading by adding more money. 

So I ended up paying 100 more dollars, totaling 169 for a detailing at such a rude customer service. I could've got it done excellently anywhere else with that much money. 

Besides it takes 3 hours! I said your website stated 40mins, and he said 40min for assessing it, haha, which only takes 1 minute. And I know where the 3 hours are gone to, they are piling up so many cars waiting for clean. Yea, they booked more than they can work on. There was another lady arguing with them about the time taken when I arrived, but there's no result.

I came in for an emergency visit on a filling that had broken off. The tooth hadn't been bothering me at all, but I wanted to get it repaired immediately. I experienced no pain, no discomfort, nothing but a rough edge to the tooth -- until I went to this office. Here I thought a new patient coupon would save me money. That was the most costly coupon I've ever redeemed.

So, this tooth-- that hadn't been bothering me at all --needed an emergency root canal, and of course a crown. On top of that, the dentist found a ""small cavity"" that he put a rather large filling in, yet my second opinion dentist didn't see it on the x-rays after-the fact..The beauty is, the filling fell out just a few short months later. Fortunately, I went elsewhere, because I was fairly certain I'd be in for another root canal after the alarmist attitude Dr. Baker originally took with me.

And, of course, I needed the same kind of over-priced deep scaling cleaning that so many previous Yelpers have complained about. My second-opinion dentist scoffed at it and stated that I had no signs of gum disease and it was probably unnecessary.

I would NEVER recommend this office. And if you're currently undergoing treatment or this office is telling you you're going to need some costly work done, get a second opinion from a dentist you can trust.",4,0,1

All they'll do is spray or fumigate which just sends the roaches scurrying to the next adjunct apartment. I also had a carpet beetle larvae infestation in my closet. These little bugs would eat holes thru my clothes and just about anything else. I remember on move-out day I vacuumed the baseboards and their carcasses were all along the baseboards mixed in with the dust that would collect behind furniture. At this point, it might be best to just burn the entire complex down and start over. 

The noise levels here suck ass, too. I used to listen to this one neighbor yell at the top of her skanky lungs for her punk son to come in. Then he'd stomp all the way up the stairs and it sounded like the god damn Hulk. I seriously thought he'd break the damn stairs off of their hinges. People party in the pool way past closing on week nights and you just wish they'd hurry up and drown. Must be nice being on government assistance\/selling meth and not having to get up for work in the A.M.  

My worst offense here was feeding a stray animal. Was never evicted, always paid my rent, never made noise or caused trouble but yet was bullied for feeding a stray. Seriously. Talk about retarded. Don't feed a stray or you'll have that hag Vanessa pounding on your door about it. I guess having a pigeon infestation is just fine, though. Oh, and some r-tard tried to steal out of my car after the one time I was too casual and left my window half-way down. This was in broad daylight.

Our party of five was told a 30 minute wait and at the 30 minute mark we could literally see them clean and reset our table from where we were standing. But it took an additional 15 minutes for them to seat us, simply because no one bothered to come get us where we stood watching the chef hand pull noodles in the front of the restaurant. There was no hostess at the front podium monitoring the situation. 

Finally seated, it took 10-15 minutes for them to fill our water glasses and take our order. They were busy-ish, so I understood to some extent. When our orders were taken, it took them about 35 minutes to check in on us again, and only then because the chef was dropping off three of our dishes from the noodle kitchen. We waited about 15 more minutes for our waitress to come back to our table with my friend's spicy chicken dish. We requested that she check on the last few dishes we were waiting on.... A curry and the dim sum that we ordered as APPETIZERS. She disappeared for 10 minutes and only came back to our table because I called out for her attention from where she loitered by the cash register. As someone who prides herself on her manners and tact, I found it extremely embarrassing that I had to go to this length to get her attention.

At this point we asked for the manager and explained why. Our waters had been empty for almost an hour. Four of us had been served entrees while the fifth waited and waited. Our appetizers never showed up. And we were never offered an apology or an explanation. The manager came over and made a laundry list of excuses. He explained that they have two kitchens... That it's hard to coordinate the dishes to come out simultaneously... That the dumplings needed time to steam... That the curry is made from scratch... All of this until I politely told him that I am an amateur home chef but I can produce a chicken curry from scratch in 30 minutes. His professional chefs should be able to do it in that time or less. 

He disappeared and then returned 5 minutes later with my friend's curry. Soon thereafter our waitress brought out the dim sum we'd ordered over an hour ago as appetizers. The manager kindly comped the food that was so late... Which was nice, but an apology from the get go would have been FAR more appreciated than the song and dance of excuses and blame he served us to begin with. He finally apologized when I pointed this out. We never got an apology from our server. 

The entire service experience was a complete and total failure. 

On the plus side, the hand pulled noodles with chicken and mushrooms were excellent, as were the BBQ buns and the spicy chicken dish (not sure of the name). 

The dumplings and the curry were bland and unseasoned. 

My one star is totally and completely for the quality of the authentic noodle dishes. Nothing else. We will not return and we will advise others not to waste their time or patience here. There are far better run authentic Chinese establishments on and around the strip.",0,0,0

It's painted by truly talented local artists and the musicians are great! Prices are very comparable (in many cases cheaper) than some of the other local Mexican\/Southwestern restaurants in the area. 

Everybody's palette is different, so keep this in mind when reading mine and others' reviews. I personally enjoyed the salsa. Others have said it was ""watery"" or ""not thick\/chunky"". Well, if you were to go to Mexico, you'd find salsa in all different textures and varieties. Paz has chosen to go with a less chunky, and still very authentic Mexican salsa - which to me is a breath of fresh air since I'm always eating Pico de Gallo at every other Mexican\/Southwestern restaurant I go to. People don't realize that many times food from other cultures that is introduced to the U.S. becomes ""Americanized"". I liked their Guacamole - definitely in my top 5 favorites

This is a great place for a group of Friends to go have some fun, great drinks and food. If you'r looking for a traditional Sit-Down quieter restaurant, don't go to Paz. This place is fun, up-beat and can definitely get loud - especially on Thursdays, Fridays & Saturdays when they have live music. They are very true to the deep & rich culture of Downtown Phoenix. 

I LOVE that the ""Sushi"" sign is still up there. Even if it just has yet to be removed, I think it adds a little bit extra quirkiness - which is what Downtown Phoenix is great at doing. 

The owning partners and staff are so grateful and nice to each guest. They are also really accommodating! I was looking at the menu, but craving a burrito. They took the Carnitas Torta and made it a burrito for me! I'm really picky about 3 things when it comes to Mexican food: Guacamole, Tortillas, and the Meat. Their handmade Tortilla was so fresh and AUTHENTIC! Not like those white flour tortillas that you can buy at the grocery store, but a real, honest to goodness hand made with love tortilla that I could swear they ran across the border to get it. The meats are fresh, the ingredients are fresh, the drinks are awesome. 

I never experience negative service with the staff, but in any case there could always be room for improvement or to be making sure of oneself when your in a customer service position. 

I love this place and love sending my guests and clients there. 

Final tip: Make sure the restaurant you're going to will fit what you're looking for. It's sad to see negative reviews on places that could have easily been avoided if people just knew what type of place they were going to. Do your homework, ask the locals, ASK YOUR CONCIERGE. Don't go to someplace just because they're Mexican food, or a casual setting, or american food, or vegan...find out more about the restaurant and find a place that fits what you are trying to accomplish other than just eating.",0,1,0

Neither of us had ever tried simply pure before... So we were both pretty excited to try a new all vegan and raw spot. 

     We walked into the tiny little container and we were greeted by a gentleman who seemed a little over the day at that point. Never the less... He proceeded to give a run down of how everything worked and even let us taste a few salad bar items before we ordered. The couscous was pretty darn good so I will be back for that. 

     We opted for the pesto zucchini pasta with sun dried tomatoes and the spring rolls to share. The prices and portions are comparable to places like sun cafe in LA and GO RAW around town. They may seem high... But they Are definitely enough to feed two people comfortably. The bill rang in at right around 20 bucks before tip. Basically... Ten dollars a person and we both left feeling full and satisfied. Order smart and you won't be breaking the bank and remember it's raw... You fill up a little quicker. 

     The pesto... Probably one of the best vegan pestos I've ever eaten... It was thick and creamy and delicious. Vegenation could use some insight and schooling from chef Stacey on what a good vegan pesto should taste like. The portion was large enough for both of us. My only regret is that we didn't put more toppings on it!! The sun dried tomatoes were a perfect touch and the texture was wonderful. The spring rolls Were fat thick pieces of heaven. They were perfectly crunchy on the inside and served with a nice sweet and sour sauce. We loved both items equally:) and finished the entire meal. 

     This is a perfect edition to the downtown area... And for somewhere like container park... It's an ideal concept. We can't wait to go back and order more of the delicious food and platters we saw... And next time we will make sure to save some room for dessert. Thank you chef Stacey for creating such a fun and delicious spot in one of our favorite areas of town!",4,2,4

We were offered the romance package - 2 tickets for a VIP gondola ride at the Venetian and a free dinner worth over $150 dollars! In reality, this meant a $17 shared gondola ride and dinner at a terrible restaurant whose food had no flavor.

Back to the hook, they tell you when you sign up that you will get a free breakfast\/lunch buffet when you arrive and it will take 2-3 hours and not to eat anything. Since the hubby and I had no plans, we signed up for the 9:45am presentation. We get to the desk at 9:15am the next morning. We're placed in a taxi and driven 10-15 mins off the strip. We sign in and wait and wait for our assigned sale person to take us, along with others into a room where we sit through a 1.5 hour or so presentation.

Since we hadnt eaten we were getting HANGRY... we are taken to the nearby casino buffet to have the most awkward lunch with our sales guy ever.............. who wants to sit and fake conversation while trying to pig out. When i let the sales guy know that we were not interested in buying a timeshare... he started getting an attitude. I told him straight up that we will not be buying and I didnt want to waste his time and we had plans at 1pm. He would not let us go early and was a jerk about us not trying to buy. When we started getting tired, the sales guy tried to say you need to listen to what im saying. The price started at $19k, after we said no, it went down to $15k, then when we said no again... it went down to $10k. The merry go round they send you on is a joke. First its the sales guy, then the sales manager, than the ppl who is suppose to get you your gift, then the ppl who actually get you your gift.

Overall the entire process was draining. We were there from 9:30am until 1:30pm. And their ""courtesy shuttle"" wouldn't even drop us off at our hotel. Definitely not worth the ""value"" and sales people and manager give you a hard time when you state you are CLEARLY not interested.

This was a big mistake. We arrive and waited in line for almost an hour to check in. Finally get to the counter and are told they only have two queen bed rooms available. My husband politely explained we would prefer a king bed as we are on vacation and would like to sleep in the same bed we had no need for two queens also when we booked it we selected a king bed. The woman checking us in was younger and quickly told us that was all they had and basically take it or leave it. We asked if it would be possible to switch rooms if one became available and she flat out said no. No offer to try to help us or make us comfortable just didn't care. On top of that had to pay $22 to get in the room before 3 which is a joke. We have stayed at so many hotels in Vegas and not one has ever charged us to check in early the room is either ready or not at this point we had been traveling all day and just wanted to get in our room. Had I known what we would be walking into I would have saved myself the $22.

 The room is a joke its super dated and just looks dirty. Everything down to the ice bucket looks like its been around since the 80's. The bathroom is just gross and the room had this strange odor which hit us right when we walked in. Decided to take a shower and turned the 80'style faucet on it made this squealing noise which lasted the entire shower I was honestly afraid to touch anything it clearly had not been properly cleaned for who knows how long the shower head had mildew all over it. The worst part was getting out and grabbing what I thought was a clean towel I could smell it right away it smelled like burnt Carmel and dirt seriously I almost threw up at the very least provide people with clean towels! After this we literally dropped our luggage and left couldn't stand to sit in the room. 

We went over to aria which we love! And they helped us out with super fair room rates for 4 nights. Yes it was so bad and we were so unhappy with the service we paid more money to stay at a different hotel! We went and checked out and expressed our dissatisfaction and right away the woman explained they can't refund us the nights and could do nothing for us. My husband tried explaining he understood they couldn't refund us but he wanted them to know how bad everything was and that we actually paid money to leave ! She hardly acknowledged our complaints and sent us on our way. Not even an apology or offer to cover resort fee or anything could seriously care less about the situation. I was super disappointed I expect more from an mgm property. It sounds like this is a recurring situation as I went over to aria to get checked in and they agreed Monte Carlo is one of the worst mgm properties to stay at. I understand the folks working at the check in counters have no control over the condition of the rooms but at least say sorry call a manager over and pretend to care. We were just dismissed like okay move on we got our money and we don't care attitude. Spend your money staying at aria there room rates are very fair and the basic rooms are updated and beautiful. The service at aria is exceptional they make you feel like royalty from start to finish. Monte Carlo needs new management and a renovation asap!",1,0,0

UPDATE!
I recently saw something that disgusted me... I was waiting in line to pay, and saw the chef scoop frying oil directly from the fryer to cook the food.

As a future biochemist, I am absolutely disgusted as I know how much toxic compounds are generated when frying food under high temperature. The oil must be changed after several days as its contents such as polyacrylamide from frying potatoes can cause breast cancers, let alone having the customers to eat it.

TL;DR: The food tastes fantastic, I still hold my opinion on that, but using deep-frying oil to cook my food is just disgusting, and the review remains 1 star (dropped from 4) until something is changed about that.",14,6,3

Which meant when our baby girl started crawling at 7 months, we knew it was time to teach her survival skills if she ever fell into our pool. I researched traditional swim schools around the area and felt that they didn't have any motivation to teach our baby those skills. Because let's face it.. the more classes they get out of us, the more money they'll get. Also, we did a trial class and baby girl screamed bloody murder through the entire class.

So I did research on private swim lessons. We found one which requires us to take the baby to a determined location 5 days a week for 10 minute lessons. It came with a 4 week guarantee, but I felt the hassle of driving there, driving back, and tugging along a feisty baby girl who hates her carseat was just too much work.

That's when I stumbled on Sunsational Swim School! The fact that the private instructor comes to your home is priceless! After the 30 minute lesson is over, we just take baby girl upstairs to wash up!

Sunsational Swim School found and partnered us with Shannon. And we love her! She's easy to communicate with in case things come up, she's flexible, she's easy to talk to, she's fun, and my baby girl loves her! She's patient with my baby and caters the lesson around her. All babies are different. They love and hate different things. And I can tell that my baby girl is comfortable and happy. That's the most important thing. 

Our first swim lesson went significantly better than the trial lesson we had before. And by the second lesson, baby girl was comfortable enough to glide under water. We're still working on floating, but lessons are going so well. And I'm so glad that we chose Sunsational Swim School. And I'm soooo happy that they paired us up with Shannon!",4,1,3

I acknowledged my timing was late for the return when speaking with the man (I assume he is the manager). After I was told what the late fee was I asked for the breakdown which he mentioned that they do call renters to remind them. I informed him I never received a call which I found odd. He then said I should have been charged automatically but my card declined. This was due to the new card issued after the Target debacle. So my credit card declines, you never receive your $140 book and never reach out to the customer, great. I asked him when he called me, which he mentioned was notated in the system. After the awkward silence and clicking around on the computer he asked for my number in order to log it on the correct account. Possibly this was the first reason I didn't receive a call, shortly after he looked up and told me what my total was. I was confused, he was supposed to be checking this imaginary call log to tell me when they called. When I asked again he said the call log was ""in the back""...so why was I waiting there for you to tell me the total once again? 
The typical response of, ""Well it will take me time to find it"" is his reasoning not to look and get me out of his store, then reverts back to saying it's my responsibility to know when the due date is etc. Which I completely agree it is and I paid the late fee. Although, do not say you have a level of service or followup when you clearly do not, then revert blame back to the customer. 
A suggestion for you and your business, refer to what information you provide on receipts or flyers regarding your policy, do not blame the customer. Also, do not create an argument to defend yourself when you clearly do not have accurate information to back it up.
I had not been late on previous rentals and requested forgiveness... Not granted.

In a nutshell the staff said they're not sellable (I wore them around my house) and I can't return it. They talked sh*t about me in front of me - if you work there FYI the loud crowd and a register between you and I doesn't drown out your sh*t talking.

I was not able to eat here so this review is based solely upon the Manager of the this restaurant. 

I arrived at the restaurant about 9:30PM on a Saturday evening.   The place was about 25 percent at capacity with no one at the bar.  Also there were only two parties sitting on the patio off the the right side.  One of the waiters told me it was okay to park my bicycle off to the one side of the patio as it was not being used.  This was a good spot as the space was not being used and the bike would have been out of sight and out of mind to any customer.

Note, that my bicycle value is in the high four figures with other equipment and bags attached on it.  Locking the bike far down the street was not something I was going to do.

I returned back to the front door unable to located the first waiter who told me I can part my bike on the front patio.  I asked a second waiter to help me locate the first waiter.  I waited 15 minutes and he never returned.  I then spoke to the hostess about where to put the bike so I can eat dinner there.  At this time, she retrieved her manager who approached me in his suit and tie.  He than informed me that I need to use the bike rack down the street.  I informed him that I do not have a lock  - and before I can finish my sentence, he looked up and down at me, sizing me up, said promptly stated, "" I can't help you.""  He then smugly turned and walked away without even looking me in the eye.

I then left.

Folks, this restaurant is located in what is called the Scottsdale Waterfront which has over 25 restaurants within short walking distance, even for fish.  Entrees are in the $40 - $50+ range.  I suppose with prices like that there is a tendency to judge customers (I rode a bike there wearing a polo shirt, shorts and bike shoes) and dish out (pun definitely intended) heaps of snobbery and attitude towards people who do not fit your customer mold.  This is a big mistake because in my pocket was green in which I was going to leave some of it behind for them.  But, no longer.

In the event management reads this review I will leave them the following ""Business Lesson.""  If someone rides a bicycle to your food perpetration service establishment....they probably live in close proximity to your place of business.  That being the case, its probably best not to turn your nose up at them.   Fact is, I do live in Scottsdale, full time I may add, and this is what occurred.

No matter how good the food is respect for the customer is paramount.  Behavior like this will only damage your market.

If you are going here to get your hair braided or even just a blow out, I'd say go for it. However, cut and color are a totally different story. 

I've been to habit salon twice. The first time I went, I had suspicions of what I'm about to talk about but thought I was just being paranoid. The second time I went I realized that I was right. 

My hair is very sensitive - it cannot take permanent color or bleach without breaking. I always get semi permanent color because of this. Makes my hair super shiny and healthy without the breakage. Semi permanent color is designed to all fade fairly equally. You should not see outgrowth! My stylist, Alisha, knew all of this and knew my problems with permanent color and it ended up she was using it anyway! I noticed my hair was breaking as it does and I had a harsh line of outgrowth after a couple of weeks. I went to get a second opinion at another salon by a senior stylist and she immediately confirmed my suspicions. 

To me it is totally disgusting to completely disregard what your client asks for. To secretly decide you're going to use something on someone's head that they have specifically told you they cannot handle is disturbing on so many levels. Everyone has unique hair and needs and at the end of the day it is up to the CLIENT what they want on their body and not what you think is best.

I'm not trendy or fashionable, so I really had no clue what I was looking for when I walked in this store. That all changed when I found out I only had 5 choices under $110 for the frames alone (buried on the last display case facing away from the door). Nonetheless, I have a fat face. Let's be honest - most days it looks like an overgrown apple growing from my body. Apparently, there are frame shapes meant for fat faces (i.e., rectangular). I spent a good 15 minutes looking at all of the glasses and, of course, did not get a rectangular frame -- primarily because in that entire 15 minutes, not one of the ten employees in the room offered assistance or guidance or anything. I was then told to ""have a seat"" on an ungodly uncomfortable backless bench to be fitted by a worker. This wait was 30 minutes - and there was only 1 person in front of me. Not a happy girl here. The chick worker (very nice) was not clear about their offers, prices, lens benefits, or frame choices\/differences. In fact, I felt like I was forcing her to give secret information when I asked about scratch resistance, UV ray blockage, and price, etc.

If you know what you're looking for and you memorize their website, this would be a fine store to shop, but you will not find a decent frame for under $170, and the 4 lenses on the website are apparently not available with all frames, because I only had 2 choices ($120 featherwates or $180 featherwates plus). Employees are not helpful, but there is a receipt book that they give you at the end of the purchase that tells you about  frame choices (i.e., after you buy your non-rectangular frames for your fat face, they tell you not to do that). You could ask for this up-front because there's nothing but posters of pretty people with pro-youth slogans all over the store.

Apparently this company offered barely any help or resolution finding a dog whom suddenly became ill while in this rescue and under the direct care of Dani Lee. If I were an employee of this company, I would contact a manager and have situations like this investigated. NO ONE should have to deal with their animal passing away. I understand that once a dog is surrendered, it is owned by the state... but if within just a few weeks or months the dog becomes violently ill and the previous owner wishes to find out a status of health AND IS DENIED, that is morally wrong. I will never do business with this company and I will make sure the almost 2,000 people on my Facebook page and various social medias are aware of this.

THE GOOD: the bed in the room was comfy (it was a king), the sheets were clean and the pillows were soft. The area in the front entrance was nice looking with the statues and water. The food court was great and we enjoyed the Bodies and Titanic exhibits which I defiantly recommend! The folks at the mLife counter were super helpful!

THE BAD: everything else! The timeshare creepers who kept stopping us EVERYTIME we walked by even without me making eye contact. Just stop!

Also there was no coffee pot or mini fridge which can be found in you average Marriott hotel nowadays, but for a luxury hotel on the strip... I guess those were not considered basic needs which caused us to eat at their food court and spend even more money.

THE UGLY: the elevator was horrible. It was very rickety and caused my husband and I to topple into other people while in there. The back door of our hotel bathroom was covered with dark finger smudges and a few red smears of goodness knows what. I had to wipe the door down before I felt clean enough to use it.

It is not the best hamburger I've ever had.
It is not the fastest hamburger place you'll go to.
It is not trendy and fancy.

What it is, is a great sort of fast-casual (read: slower than McDonalds, faster than a sit-down restaurant) restaurant.  

The burgers are high quality for a casual dining restaurant.  They have a few different varieties of burgers, all coming in either 1\/3lb or 1\/2lb versions.  You can also build your own using any combination of their available toppings.  

Highlight of the entire meal for me :  Adding a fried egg on top of my burger.  My wife makes fun of me for it, but toss a fried egg on a burger, and I'm in heaven.  This place tosses a perfectly fried egg ontop of a delicious burger...fantastic.

The fries are quite tasty as well.  Our super-friendly cashier informed us that the fries are actually McDonalds' old french fry recipe, before they switched to canola oil, etc.  She says Smashburger bought the recipe\/etc and now use it as their own.  Who knows if that's true, but it sure did taste true.  Delicious, crispy, salty...amazing.  Just like McD's used to make - you know, before they took out the trans fats, etc.  Maybe they aren't health food...but as a time-to-time indulgence, not so terrible.  They offer regular varieties with sea salt, or they have ""SmashFries"" with olive oil, rosemary, etc.  They also have Sweet Potato fries...  Hard to choose just one, as they are each great for their own reasons.  Honestly, I think the regular salted fries are my favorite, but not by much.

We tried the Smashchicken crispy too - not bad!  Hard to order chicken at a place that does such good burgers, but it was quite tasty.  Not the highest quality cut of bird, but it was white meat and tender and pretty darn good.  

Finally...the milkshakes.  Nothing earth-shattering, but definitely quality.  The chocolate was smooth without being overpowering.  They also have a ""cactus vanilla"" which is a blend of vanilla and prickly pear.  I loved it.  Subtle prickly pear flavor with a good strong vanilla.  I really enjoyed it.

The prices aren't fast food low.  Between 2 of us, we were easily over $20...but we didn't exactly skimp on anything either.  2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 milkshakes.  

We'll definitely return, and I suggest you give it a shot as well.",1,0,1

My girlfriend and I decided to go on a week day around 4ish. They have parking right in the front of the area. At first when you get out you may be confused because the building doesn't say ice cream shop! But there is a small sign\/walkway that says ""ice cream this way""

It takes you on a small path behind the building into a garden\/backyard where you can find the delicious ice cream shop. 

It's very clean inside and organized. They have tons of different flavors to choose from. My favorite part about this ice cream shop is that the police station is near by and you can actually buy a police dog stuffed animal and with the police dogs photo on it! It's pretty epic! 

I decided to go with the strawberry ice cream! I added a few sprinkles on top and I have to say it was a pretty damn good ice cream!

An hour later we finally got our pizza which was disappointingly not worth the wait --barely any toppings and the pizza dough seemed store bought. The  upside is that the pizza was hot.  The downside is that that's the upside. P.s the chili oil has no spice to it.  On top of all of this, we were surrounded by drunk men yelling to each other back and forth from the bar to the front table. Men, by the way, who were pouring alcohol from their flasks into their drinks while the server wasn't looking.  The server couldn't have been less apologetic about the experience and how long the food took.

In addition, he answered a lot of questions about my goal of early retirement, and gave me great guidance about how to structure my finances for a stable flow of income.  He analyzed the issue of when to take Social Security (and the answer can be different for all of us, based on dozens of different factors), and set me on the right track there.  He's also available during the course of the year for many what-if questions:  

1) Should I refinance my mortgage?
2) Is it better to just make additional payments in order to retire it sooner?
3) At what point is the standard deduction greater than my mortgage interest?
4) How much can I earn and not lose any of my Social Security when I'm under 66?

bwE38zm6hPCuGvwbHUuF-w,_SLYbwsQd500o5iLj1xEVw,myJ6pgIhN42EQh2sAVXKoQ,1,2016-02-23,"On a fateful Sunday afternoon, after an unsuccessful attempt to obtain jamaican patties (I had forgotten that the best places are closed Sunday), we decided that the best alternative would be to sink our teeth in a juicy, delicious burger. Heading back towards downtown, we googled the best burger in Toronto and saw amazing reviews for Toma, along with awards and distinctions. Perfect!

The gods were on our side as we found parking right across the street and headed inside to the joys of gustation. The menu was exciting, and I found myself drawn by several selections but finally settled on an enticing combination of pulled pork and beef patty. After one mischievous glance towards my dining partner, we also both agreed on ordering classic poutines to accompany this fine feast. Being both from Quebec, we had our doubts but figured that someone, by now, would be able to perfect this unhealthy yet satisfying culinary delight in Toronto at last. The online reviews all raved about it, after all.

The slow service did not dissuade us from enjoying our time at Toma, as the ambiance (and the company) was nice. Large booths allowed us to spread out and salivate at the thought of these delicious aliments that would shortly be presented to us.

The food arrived. A finely crafted burger branded with a large ""T"" on the top of the bun was set next to a beautiful bowl of french fries smothered in sauce and... wait, what's wrong with the curds?

The classic poutine was neither classic nor poutine. While the french fries could, I'm sure, be quite nice on their own, their size meant they were completely overwhelmed by the sauce. The curds were... strange at best. I still can't figure out if they were actually cheese. They looked like pieces of processed mozzarella (the kind you get in No Name bricks) passed through a spaetzle maker and had no characteristic taste or flavour. Its texture introduced me for the first time to the feeling of having semen in my mouth from multiple glory holes, an experience I would rather not repeat. The sauce had an off taste, not just from being over salted (which we all come to expect in restaurant fare), but as if a squirrel or other small land mammal had taken to swimming in the vat and left behind a special mix of seasonings.

The burger was equally strange. The bun was, at best, fine, but the beef patty had no distinctive taste that would make one go ""wow"". In fact, the texture was a bit off, as if the ground meat had been overworked. The cheese also had a particularly strange taste. If such cheese had been served on Alderaan, the tremor in the force would have been one of relief. My dining partner, who had ordered a much more classic combination, had a similar reaction.

Starvation does not equal causation. We reluctantly finished the burger as we had had nothing else to eat that day, but left the seed-laden french fries aside and walked back out amazed that such cookery would obtain such rave reviews and awards. We are not hipsters or againsters, and can in fact enjoy food from all levels, from dives to fine dining. I can even find redeeming qualities in some of the worst fast food out there. Something was way off here.

But this is not where the story ends.

The combination of ingredients ingested minutes earlier began to combine in fast digestion as my body decided that Toma was best left out of my system. Minutes later, just as the so-called brioche bun was branded with a large ""T"", so would my anus be branded by the intense burn of hellfire as one ingredient after another used my insides as a boiling cauldron of witch brew that would punish me for not only the next hours, but the next day as well. Less than an hour after the last mastication, I had to sit at the porcelain throne to spew out a stream of acid that actually made me cry. As the stream of molten lava came pouring out of me, I converted from atheism to three different major religions and a few minor ones as well, as only some sort of divine punishment could explain the terror that was coming out of my bowels. Each rumbling of my stomach made me cry out for forgiveness, as my body was transformed into a geyser of burning, liquid excrement four more times that night. I collapsed in a cold sweat on the floor of the bathroom, crawling back to bed with hesitation as I pictured with horror the inevitable result of my body falling asleep and relaxing its sphincters.

While I was lucky enough to make it through the night without chemical burns on my thighs, the next day was dreadful as I had to take the road towards Ottawa by car, with my stomach still churning and warning me that this plague was not over with. I thank the designers of the OnRoute system and apologize for the strange chemical offshoot that they will have noticed in their water filtration. My new god Ogoun Badagris will receive offerings on their behalf.

Definitely an unforgettable experience.",2,9,2

It was well packaged with a handwritten card and business card attached. It was a very personal touch to have the card handwritten. Later that day after 5pm, I received confirmation email from Jacquelyn with a photo of the flowers.

Overall, communication and customer service with Wild North Flowers went smoothly and replies were quick if I had any questions. Flowers were reasonably priced, beautiful arrangement and I would definitely recommend trying this florist out. It's rare to find a local florist, plus 2% of their sales each month goes to a different charity each month. Let's support our local growers!",3,0,0

I really could finish the review right there, but for the sake of clarity I will continue. 

Season's 52 name comes from the fact that it changes the menu seasonally and they have 52 wines available by the glass. In addition to the seasonality of the menu, they have an extensive list of specials which changes weekly. There are also changing wine selections. No item on the menu is more than 475 calories, which is pretty amazing.

Our server was Ryan and he was epitome of excellence. Engaging, friendly, there when we needed him, away when we didn't. Knowledgeable of the menu, including the wine list.

I selected a glass of gamay from the sommelier's recommended list and it didn't disappoint.

We ordered the lobster and shrimp flatbread appetizer which was light and delicious, with just a hint of cilantro.  For a starter the gf ordered the beets - tasted great but the presentation was a bit boring. I had the steamed shrimp spring rolls and they were fresh and served with three dipping sauces.

For entrées my vegetarian gf was in heaven and had quite the selection to choose from. She ended up with the seasonal vegetable plate (no surprise, right?) - she was very impressed by both the portion size and the selection (given the 475 calorie limit). I had the rainbow trout served with roasted vegetables and the fish separated from the skin effortlessly and was fresh and moist.

For dessert we selected two of the mini indulgences, which for only $2.50 each are a perfect size and price for the sweet finish to a great meal.

It wasn't until the next day that I found out that Season's 52 is a chain and owned by Darden's (of Olive Garden fame). This really surprised me as it didn't look like a chain and the food and service aren't anything you would associate with a chain, so kudos for them for a job well done.",3,1,1

The mains - being a somewhat drizzly evening - had two of us ordering the boeuf bourgignion.

Fiori's is one pizza shop that we go out of our way for. Their pies are always fresh right from the oven and you can see the crew make every one. There is some seating in the spot, but it can fill up fast on a Saturday night.

The pizzas are great just on their own with no toppings, but if you want to jazz it up the toppings are fresh and super tasty. You can even order a side of mozzarella to put on top of your slice! The hoagies are also fairly large and enough for at least two to share. I've tried the steak hoagie previously and instead of a white\/cheese sauce it comes with a red ""secret"" sauce which is really good.

From the opening notes of the hymn, ""All are welcome in this place"", I knew how special Saint Patrick's was to me.

""Let us build a house
where love can dwell
And all can safely live,
A place where
saints and children tell
How hearts learn to forgive.""

There are so many things I want to share about coming here for 5 pm Mass. First is coming into their sacred space and hearing a first class Choir and musicians practicing . Their group also includes a pianist, a person on Keyboard and a very young College age drummer.  They were great, and not just for the practice, but throughout the service. They all worked well together and didn't overwhelm the senses. The music of Paul Hillebrand and the heavenly voice of their Cantor Jill Bagshaw are incredible and needs to be experienced to be appreciated.  

""Let us build a house where prophets speak,
And words are strong and true,
Where all God's children dare to seek
To dream God's reign anew.""

Second is the friendly parishioners who sat around me, including some long time friends. Even though Father Eric was away on vacation, the folk at Saint Patrick's didn't seem to miss a beat. Their ministry to the poor of spirit here in the valley is well known, particularly their efforts at Justa Center.  But it's also the nearly four dozen other ministries, where they offering themselves as the hands and body of Christ, which makes you realize how special this community is.

""Let us build a house where love is found
In water, wine and wheat:
A banquet hall on holy ground,
Where peace and justice meet.""

I've come to Mass here many times and the Liturgy is wonderful. I have never felt this way in any other Catholic Church.  It is so moving, to stand up and have the entire church hold hands for The Lord's Prayer, and I do mean everyone. It's special and I only wish I could convey how moving it is to feel the spirit in this church when it happens. It's just amazing to have over five hundred members standing, holding hands and reciting not a prayer by rote, but with feeling and love that makes it so special. 

""Here the love of God, through Jesus,
Is revealed in time and space;
As we share in Christ the feast that frees us:

All are welcome, all are welcome,
All are welcome in this place.",35,14,27

But enough about the food, it was the service that threw us over the edge. Not only did it take 15-20 mins for the server to greet us but after he brought us our food we never saw him again! We literally had to get up from our table at one point and search to pay our bill! I can't even remember if that's ever happened to me before.

We passed up the Justin Timberlake and Friends concert in lieu of this excuse for ""entertainment"".  Furthermore, I was subjected to an overpriced Nathan's Hot Dog dinner because we were in a rush to make the show.  BASTARD!!!

Criss is a horrible actor, his 5 tricks were predictable, and he couldn't sing.  He even attempted to dance!!  If I had them, I would have kicked my own balls at that point...it would have been a lot less painful.

Dont expect to be impressed with anything other than the beautiful set and costumes.  Days later, we were still trying to figure out what the f**k his vision was AND how any Luxor executives could allow this production to go on.  Also, don't expect Criss to NOT stroke his ego, since the whole show is a supposed look into the mind of the ""master"" illusionist.

At our show, Criss mentioned the president of the Luxor was in attendance.  Holy crap...if you have any brains, Mr. Executive, you will stop this mess before it tanks.

Our exit poll revealed no one was entertained or impressed...and more often than not, people wanted their money back.  In fact, we witnessed several people leaving in the middle of the show.  I only wish I had been one of them....

While waiting for the valet afterwards, my boyfriend levitated a la David Blaine and delighted a passerby who, to this day, is probably more impressed by that 10-second illusion than anyone in the Believe audience.

They also have a pizza menu, chopped salads and appetizers. beverages include a full bar and ""adult milkshakes"" with your favorite booze whizzed in. Mmmm!

I ordered their signature burger the ""Juicy Lucy'--an 8oz patty stuffed AND topped with the cheese of your choice. I went pretty standard with my toppings:  Bacon, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and 1000 Island. It was HUGE and delicious. I finished what I could and have a healthy portion leftover in my fridge. 

My partner had a 7oz burger with onion strings, bacon, cheddar, and blue cheese. It was equally impressive, although he was able to finish his. Champ! They do offer a 4oz burger for the lighter eaters. 

We shared an order of steak fries that were PERFECTLY crisp on the outside and tender potato-squishy on the inside. Although we are ketchup dippers, we were automatically offered ranch for our fries. That's always nice.

We ate in the bar area. As our hostess pointed out, the stools in there have comfy cushioning for your toosh. She was correct. The bar was less busy than the dining area at 12pm. It offers video poker, big screens for the sports fans, and smoking.  Our server, Nicole, was sweet, but not ""goopy.""

I got a groupon for it, not really expecting much of it but boy, from the second I walked in, it felt like a very nice place.

Towards the end, we weren't even sure if we wanted dessert but the 3 layer ice cream was delicious! We just laughed when we enjoyed it so much because this place just continued to impress us with every taste. The complimentary bread was very fresh and baked to perfection. The Caesar salad was also very fresh and tasty. The soup was made from scratch.

We spent two hours of the first day of our San Diego vacation in a very hot garage trying to get the van lift and doors to work. The outside temperature was around 90° that day and it was much hotter inside the garage. Unfortunately the only other van that was available was a van that had been ""put out of service.""  Wheeler's words, not ours. 

It was clear from the beginning why that van had been put out of service. First, neither the door nor the lift were electric. I specifically requested a van with an electric door and lift because my husband has a bad back. We never would have chosen Wheeler's if we would have been told we would be receiving a van with a manual lift and door. The new van not only was all manual but it was also really bouncy because the shocks are in bad shape.  I was in neck pain the entire trip because of all that bouncing around. As well, the brakes were very touchy. If you just tried to gently put on the brakes, the van stopped  abruptly. There may have been other reasons why the van had been put out of service but those were the issues that affected us.

Wheeler's does not maintain their vans. Wheeler's saves money by not having a person in San Diego who does maintenance. We were not unable to go on a sailboat ride that we had planned because of all of the time wasted plus the poor condition of the van we did take.",0,0,0

That review was about poor service and poor food and I gave them the benefit of the doubt as they were new. This review is based upon my second visit last night. 
The best thing about the meal was the refreshing hot towel at the end. The best way to describe the rest is truly awful.
We had a mixed platter starter which was alleged chicken satay, some sort of meat by product won ton, spring rolls and sesame toast. The satay was truly awful. It had a rubbery texture and was quite obviously the cheapest quality they could get. I guessed it was reformed chicken breast that had been boiled and then sold frozen. It was disgusting. The wonton too had similar unidentifiable meat in it and we could not eat it.
The main course was a red chicken curry even though we had asked for green and an unidentifiable duck dish. The chicken dish was not nice. It was cold, hardly any chicken in it and the sauce had split slightly through cooling and reheating leaving a slightly grainy texture. The duck dish was at best - ok. But what really got me was the shoddy service whereby the spoons we had to eat with had to double up as serving spoons until the manager noticed half way through and brought out some more.
Unfortunately with the chicken starter sitting really heavy the rest of the meal was a write off. We left everything. The manager asked if everything was ok and I told him no it was not. Did we receive any apology or discount ? No we did not. We left.

GrassRoots just added pressed juice; I look forward to trying it. This is the first place in the Vegas valley, that I know of, to make juice that is both pressed and organic.

she offered to let us see two rooms to decide on which we would like to stay in since housekeeping was running behind etc. After seeing both rooms we were offered the answer two staying in either room was absolutely a NO. so i politely went back to the office and told her i wanted to cancel my reservation.... with a snappy reply she said ""No. im not going to accept the cancelation"" I asked her why? and she says ""becauase you have to cancel 24 hrs prior to your stay"" so as i began to reply and talk about how i only booked my stay literally 4 hrs earlier they should have some exception to this policy. she cuts me off mid conversation and started talking about reasons she will not refund us this and that so i stopped her and asked if i could finish what i was saying first. she stopped and listend but it didnt matter.. she told me i needed to contact my booking company if im havinv issues.. so i politely thanked her, took her name, and left... 

A hour later i call my booking company and they tried to resolve the situation by calling and talking to ""heather"" as well and asked to speak with her supervisor, but she claimed their was no supervisor available. the booking company advised me to try and get ahold of her upper management to try and resolve the situation..

the next day i call the hotel back and ,of course, the same lady answers... she says ""hello knights inn"" and i ask for a supervisor or manager and she says this is her... and she sounded familiar so i asked for her name and she replies (heather) i laugh and say ok no heather i need to speak with your higher up and she replys ( im as high as it goes ) so i say ""ok, so you own the hotel?"" and she of course says ( no ) and then i say ( well then you have a higher up) she comments ( well there is a district manager but hes not here) i ask for the number for him and shw refuses... and i say well there has to be someone above you i can talk to right now...she says ( nope im the assistant manager im the only one here most the  time but my DMs name is *******  ((fyi she told me in the beginning of the call that shes as high as it goes and she is the ""assistant manager"" smh. ))) anyways, i say ok thanks... we will be in touch. and hang up.....

me currently i called the actual franchise and spoke to customer service who said i should have no issues getting my refund.... 

i have never had problems with knightsin in the past but this place was the poster child for crack hotel with horrible customer service and managemt... i hope this lady gets fired because there is no reason why she had to be sooo rude to me from the beginning. That is horrible leadership on her part and also shes giving this hotel a bad bad name....",2,1,0

I recently had eyebrows removed and it's still very dark which means more sessions and more pain. Other employees will come into the room like if there is no session going on. After 3 weeks of having tattoo removed it was only 10% lighter so that means having to come back. Of course you are told at the same time they can do the procedure of micro blading. Uh...NO WAY.

We tried the  sample buckeye rolls and ordered two corned beef rolls and one steak roll. I tried the one corned beef roll. It was covered in a mix of shredded cheese that doesn't melt that I scrapped off. It was very greasy and a weird funky color. It tasted like very old sour oil. There were remains of crisp corned beef fragments in the roll but their flavor didn't make it over the overwhelming fowl grease taste. This was the WORST THING I STUCK IN MY MOUTH this year.

My husband tried the steak roll and he said it was bad in a different way......

We were suppose to have another corned beef roll but they gave us something unidentifiable light color meat that wasn't on the menu.

I didn't mention this before but we waited and extremely long time for our order. There was a man before us that was waiting longer than us and he left without his food or his money back. The people at the food truck asked us if we wanted his food. Of course we declined.

Do I have Las Vegas to thank for this?  Maybe so!

There was Mario Batali and Tom Douglas in Seattle earlier this year, Hubert Keller, Rick Moonen, and now finally Charlie Palmer.  And Mr. Palmer actually cooked my dinner!

As people have expressed in their reviews here, Charlie Palmer Steak has one of the best specials going on the strip that I have ever seen, their ""Cut of the Week"" prix fixe 3-course menu with UNLIMITED WINE PAIRINGS for only $48 per person.  Yes you heard me, ALL YOU CAN DRINK WINE PAIRINGS.  This is no cheap wine either, my friends.  This is the good stuff.  One of the courses we had was this wonderful Bastianich Winery selection, which goes for probably $40 per bottle.

This particular week the courses were:

First Course:
Composed Salad - organic watercress, poached pairs, goat cheese mousse, hazelnut Vinaigrette.

Main Course:
14 ounce Grass Fed New York Strip Loin - with caramelized sweet onions and smoked sea salt

Sides:
Butternut Squash Risotto, Roasted Root Veggies

Desert:
Dark Chocolate Spearmint Bar

Without going into massive detail about each course, everything was pretty spot on and lovely.  Except the steak.  Not my husband's steak, my steak.  It was weird, the flavor was completely different from his, and it was tough and bland.  

You're probably wondering why I gave a tough and bland steakhouse five stars.  Since it tasted so differently than my husband's it was an obvious execution mistake, so I sent it back.  They were so apologetic and went to recook it.  When it came back, it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.  They said, ""chef made it himself,"" and I looked up and there was Charlie Palmer himself running around in a cook's jacket.  Very impressive, and it was amazingly cool.  On top of it, we got a complimentary truffled baked potato, which was amazing.  Every time I have had a truffled potato dish in a high end restaurant, I have been disappointed.  This was perfect.

Anyway, I have seen some great selections on the cut of the week menu.  A few weeks ago they had some snake river farms beef selections.  If you have not had snake river farms waygu beef, it is absolutely amazing.  I believe this is the American Waygu beef that Cut uses on their menu as well.

So to wrap things up here, try Charlie Palmer Steak mainly for the cut of the week menu.  I can't compare it to other high end steakhouses on the strip because they don't have such an amazing deal, but my husband and I really loved this meal and are looking forward to going again.",2,1,2

I found this store through Yelp and browsed around their website. They have a long list of firearms they carry and even show the prices for the majority of them. They seem to update their inventory everyday on their site.

Good thing I read the reviews first on here instead of driving straight there. You need to call them ahead of time and make an appointment if you want to take a look or purchase an item. Their doors will be locked when you get there and you will need to knock. It probably depends how busy they are, so you might be lucky enough to walk in and be able to have an associate help you.

I called immediately right when they open at 10AM and Sherrie was able to squeeze an appointment in for me at 11AM the same day. When I arrived, I was greeted immediately and their store is like no other. It is more of an office setting in the front and a show room in the back. Sherrie grabbed the Glock I was looking for and showed and explained a detail about it. She also took the time to answer any questions I had.

The paper work was a breeze and I was very happy with my overall experience. Make sure you pay with cash to get the best deal! With my purchase I also received a cool key chain, patch and lanyard which was plus!

They are so nice at the store to sell you something, but that's it. We bought a sofa bed and it was expected to be delivered on a Sunday, between 11-2pm. Of course they were almost 3h late, but the surprise was: we needed to have the elevator on service mode so they could deliver the couch. We were never told about this policy, and even though we explained that it was an old building and that the elevator doesn't go on service mode, they said they would need to reschedule and that the building manager should be present.

But the frosting of the cake was: during this whole thing, the store was apparently too busy whenever I called from my phone (the one I gave when I made the purchase) and it was always going to voicemail, I had to call from my work phone or my husband's phone if I wanted them to pick it up! 

They were unbelievably rude after that, as if they were making us a favour because we bought the couch on sale. Really? In the end it was still a 959.00 purchase . I don't think it was even that cheap anyway. If you can't do sale, just don't do it.

There were two customers getting haircuts and approximately 3 stylists standing around talking not really doing anything. Barely got any kind of acknowledgement or even a hello. Advised I'd like to get a haircut. They all had a look on their face that it would be a bother to try to cut my hair (especially the lady with purple\/pink hairdo she is downright rude). Every one of the stylists with me standing right there all start going back and forth with each other making excuses why they shouldn't have to help me. ""I can't do it have her do it."" Well I'm not going to do it have this person do it"" and so on you get the idea. Makes you feel welcomed wouldn't it? Finally I just say forgot and sorry to bother everyone.

Then tried to tell me the display case one was the same one same size and I believed it and bought it. Soon realized the damn ring is two sizes smaller than the one I reserved for pickup. They were completely dishonest and didn't honor their word and resold the ring. In fact the day I show up to pick up the ring nobody has any clue what I'm talking about.

It was at that moment that I should have turned around and ran to one of the many Vegas  restaurants run by celebrity chefs.  But against my better judgement I proceeded to pay.  We were greeted and seated by a friendly staff, but the food was just as bad or worse than many of the chain restaurants throughout the west coast.  The food was ok and worse.  Not a single item was grand or great.  The crab (which is supposed to be the star of the show) is served cold with cocktail sauce and lemon.  That's right... no butter!  Instead of the king crab that some patrons rave about they served an anorexic Dungeness crab leg that looked like it was pulled out of murky waters of Mekong River.

Additionally, the mussels were horrible.  I took one bite and got a mouthful of gravel.  I guess the cooks at the Bellagio had no time to soak the with such a high demand for their mediocre fair.

Finally, the dessert was ok, and I may have been inclined to to eat more of the cheese ravioli if I hadn't lost my appetite from the mouthful of gravel that I crunched through my teeth. I might spit out enough to fill that little pothole on Flamingo.

No more buffets for me.  When you pay $70+ for a meal that tastes worse than Chili's in Barstow I think that's time to call it quits on the once glorious experience of the Vegas life.

I had a relatively small order for which I really wanted a unique design for, so I was a bit unsure if they would be able to accommodate me.  

Michelle Ng was able to integrate the ideas that I had and come out with an AMAZING design.  I just received the shorts in the mail and they are far above what I had even hoped for!!!

I love supporting small businesses that are growing because they are run by good, hard-working people.  From my experience, that is exactly what makes VC stand out.  Great customer service and communication hand in hand with a great product!

I was shopping for an elderly home-bound neighbor and she asked me to stop at Carl's Jr. to get her a hamburger. Nothing special here; Stopped at the Carl's Jr. and ordered her burger. Paid. Got the food. It wasn't until I asked for the receipt that things got weird. The cashier told me that receipts are only issued on request and it would be a minimum of 5 minutes if I wanted to wait for it. I asked why so long and he said ""That's how long it takes to generate a receipt"". 

I am not about to wait 5 minutes for the receipt as the food gets cold. It the order were mine I would have demanded a refund and let them throw the burger in the trash. However, I do feel it necessary to provide a receipt when spending my neighbors money. I left without the receipt and noticed a sticker-sign on the door. Call this number if you have any questions or problems. I called from the parking lot and was connected to the voice mail of someone named Sandra. I left a message explaining what had happened, providing my name and cell number, and asked that I be contacted with information on Carl's receipt policy.

Alas, that is all background information, as the true reason for this review is to document how poor the customer service is and just how unimportant a paying customer is to Carl's Jr. Restaurants. Here is what happened since then:

Using the Carl's website I sent an email through the ""Contact Us"" link. The site specified that a reply could take up to 5 days, a time-frame that seems excessive, but at least they were upfront about the slow reply rate. Maybe they had only a couple people to sift through all of the emails. More likely there were more complaints than any number of people could handle. I regret I can not post my original email, but it was sent from their site, not my email carrier. Alas, I have no access to it. You will have to trust is was much like my phone message requesting a copy of their receipt policy -- let the 5 day clock begin.

 -------------------------  On  day 3 I received the following email:

Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us.
We do not have any further information for you at this time.  However, I have forwarded your message to the appropriate department for their review and requested that they follow-up on your comments.
Please feel free to contact us again at any time.

 -------------------------  On  day 6 I sent the following email:

To whom it may concern:

On Friday, May 4th, I sent an email through the ""contact us"" link of your web site. 3 days later I received this auto responder saying that ""We do not have any further information for you at this time"", and I have yet to be informed that there *is* additional information.

My simple request of informing me of your receipt policy was sparked by an oddity on my last visit to Carl's. It is now obvious that the reason neither I, nor other patrons, were given receipts was that the transactions were not rung into the register. Be advised that I no longer need that policy, the reason for which is described below.

* The response time from your web site is long, and in my opinion, unacceptable. *To date, I have yet to hear back from anyone.*
* In addition to sending that email I called the telephone number posted on the door and left a voice mail. *To date, I have yet to hear back from anyone.*
* A simple request like the one I had originally made should have been handled in under 24 hours.
* It is now apparent that customers are a terrible inconvenience to you, therefor, I shall make your jobs easier by cancelling the request for the information and no longer being a customer. The service I have received is equal to that in the restaurant(s). Slow. I shall not bother returning.

 -------------------------  On  day 7 I received the following emails:

Thank you for taking the time to contact us.

I assure you that every effort is being made to address this situation.  I have escalated the report concerning your initial comments and these additional comments.  I have contacted the appropriate management regarding your experience at this particular restaurant as well as forwarded your comments to our corporate representatives.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to address your concerns.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call (877) 799-7827.

-------------------------  And:

My name is Sandra Bacon and I am the District Manager for the store that you vistited (visited) last week. I'm sorry that you did not get my response. It is much easier to have a phone number to call than rely on email. I would like to personally talk to you regarding the reciept (i before e EXCEPT after c) issue. If you would please call me on my cell at 702-561-2101.

Having not brought my phone with me as things tend to get stolen at places like this I could not double check if he was lying or not and trusted that a bartender would not take my cash if my card had worked (my mistake) my card had been charged AND I paid this man in cash which left me with $290 for a few measly fireball shots... such a scam. Beyond this incident my friend had her drink roofied (we assume on the dance floor) at this club and was sick the remainder of our trip. We are aware this is not the clubs fault but it just put the cherry on top of the negative experience that came out of an otherwise fun night.

I've been here about 6 times. Mostly take out and one dine in occasion.

I've never had one of those experiences where I notice someone order AFTER me and still get their food first. Until here! 

I remember that occasion. We ordered a pizza, and two appetizers. Our pizza came out literally 45 minutes after ordering it, they bring the one appetizer another 5 minutes later, and then the second appetizer just about the hour mark. One of those that's it I'm leaving moments but I stuck it out. We were in there when there were maybe 2 other small parties were there so I just didn't understand. They had a lot of workers but we maybe got one refill when we asked after we ate. 

There was never a ""sorry out kitchens baked up"" or even a just plain ""sorry it's taking so long"". That tells me they don't see a problem.

How hard is it to fry up some garlic balls to bring out as an appetizer? How about wings? That should have come out first to freaking offset the pizza wait! Restaurant and service 101!

Our entire meal took almost an hour and a half. 

Granted the take out line started getting busy we still ordered way before it got busy.

Then tonight I went and took a take out order and our crust was burnt on our pizza. 

Sorry but that was the last straw. I just can't see myself eating here again.

Yes their garlic balls are good and cheap but I'll go elsewhere at all costs. 

Their ordering sucks. You call and automatically get placed on hold. WHY?! I was in there and both girls did that. WHY?! They weren't even doing anything that couldn't wait!

Also the staff sucks.

Customer service and personality go along way. I don't see how that girl works there. She must be related or own the place. Dark hairs girl that is a little pale. Sorry to put her out there but she just sucks. One time she gave me a free ranch with my order but I left a tip larger than the cost of the ranch so that doesn't make up for it. 

There's no appreciation of the customer. I'd rather eat where they have good service and good food as opposed to bad service and great food.

When I checked in I was asked if I wanted a room overlooking the pool area. I was also warned that from 3 to 11 on Saturdays there is a live band by the pool. I was totally fine with it as I was not in my room during that time. I did however return to my room on Sunday night at 11 p.m. for a good nights sleep before my early flight the next morning. Hotels are ALSO for sleeping even if you are in Vegas. I laid my head down only to experience the thump thump thump of the base, the DJ and the strobe lights emanating from The Mandalay Bay Daylight Club on the other side of the pools that were below my window. WTF??? I was never told about this when I checked in to my room and I cannot believe that a hotel would have an outdoor club open until 3 or 4 a.m.  I am by no means a curmudgeon and like to party like the next person but REALLY??? I listened to this club crap for 3 hours just waiting for it to stop. Once it did, my head was pounding and my sleep left little to be desired. 

Other issues that I experienced were the long check-in line and the lack of elevators during the day. There were 8 elevators in my lobby. I waited while only two elevators worked. When they opened they were jam packed with customers and their suitcases on the way to leave. The same elevators would go up and down only to open with the same people. I ended up walking down 13 flights of stairs (with two other people) that took us through Human Resources dept. of Mandalay Bay. Not very secure if you ask

From their first visit in August, once a month, until today, there have been issues. Tried to deal with them without bothering the landlord, but each month, different workers, different responses from them. Last month, when I tried to talk to the guy blowing my kids toys into the far corner of the yard, under the bushes, he told me to ""go back inside and let him get back to work"". He then called me a ""stupid bitch"" under his breath thinking I wouldn't hear him. Instead of confronting him directly, I tried to contact the company. No response. Nothing. Life went on, raising two kids, getting ready for the holidays, family & friends. This morning, when they came back, just as disrespectful, I was done. Called the number, someone answered, and I told them what was going on. The guy (the manager?) continued to be disrespectful and tell me that the issues I was having with his crews, wasn't his problem. If you dislike people so much and don't care about their problems with your employees, hire someone else to deal with your customers. You don't have to agree with your customers, but if your being paid to provide them services, problems will arise. And your complete lack of humility and respect are disgusting.

To respond to their comment, all your crew does is blow the dirt and leaves around, since we've lived here, 2 plants have died, the drip irrigation system isn't working and the landlord had to have another company come and trim the tree in front. Not sure what you think you're ""protecting"". But your crew won't be back here. Problem solved.

You told me that you don't have time for my issues, but you keep regurgitating this. It's simple, you were disgusting with me on the phone, your services are no longer required.  Get over it.

There were no washcloths, dirty towels, hair in the shower and the shower never got warm (which I didn't find out until 4am when I was getting ready for my flight). No hot breakfast for me (and I knew this) but when I checked in the gentleman at the desk said I could take a granola bar and some fruit in the morning.  Morning came and the desk gentleman at that time said he couldn't give me any breakfast food.

The shuttle was prompt in taking me home, but the driver was somewhat overbearing and didn't allow for easy conversation.

After waiting 5 hours I had to call about my car and received an answering machine. 45 minutes later I was called back and told that my car still wasn't done. After calling the shuttle for my return trip it took another 90 minutes for the shuttle to come get me.

I recommended for them to call the call center and have them extend their hours so that they can inform their clients of this as well locking the door and just allowing the last client out when their ready.

There is spilled juicebox and substances that ... I dont even want to know what they are that get stuck all up and under the car seats.  So I was happy when an autobell just opened right by my house.  Paid my $36 for the special plus tip and was expecting them to make her look all pretty again.  Terrible experience.  First I pulled to the side to take out 2 of the car seats, I couldnt take the third out until the last minute because I had my 2 year old with me and couldnt pull him out until I pulled up to the start.  So while I was struggling to hold onto him and get the carseat out the guy tells me can I do that on the side next time cause Im holding up the line!!!  Whaaa???  NO, I couldnt unless you want me to drive around with my 2 year old loose in no seat.  And if you would have offered to help me while I was struggling with a 2 year old and a really tight car seat instead of staring at me and complaining it would have gone a whole lot faster!  Forget good service, what happened to good old fashioned shivalry??  If I see someone struggling I never just stand there and watch!    
Rude!
So then it comes around and I have to go out there because I notice they are not vacumming the back, ""ok mam"" we will do it.  Then they tell me its done and I go out there and the car seat I specifically told him to clean under is not clean at all.  Didnt even try.  So I said ""um"" I asked you to clean under here, thats why I struggled all that time to get the carseats undone"" and he cleaned it. Yep, it was gross, probably a months worth of fruit snacks stuck on there, but guess what YOUR A CAR WASH SO WASH IT! 
So annoying.
So after having to bug them to do there job I went home at least thinking the car was done.  Nope.  Once I got home I noticed when they picked the wipes and a book off the ground and put it on the seat they never put it back to clean the seat in the front.  Full on crumbs and stuff all over it.  The console in the middle also had spilled coffee still on it.    I have 3 messy kids (4 if you count my husband) and a slipped disc in my back so I cant be leaning over scrubbing.  But after spending $36 dollars to have my car cleaned I had to go home get out the dustbuster and rags and do just that.  

I bet people with kids are the ones who get their cars cleaned the most so car washes should be bending over backwards to treat me right, instead they were unhelpful when I was struggling, had to be pushed to clean my car and in the end didnt even do it all.  I have a free wash coupon from a calander I bought there so unfortunately they will get one more chance with me but I doubt they can persuade me to ever pay for another one with them.

I went in March 2016 to this dealership to help my grandmother with purchasing a Certified used 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan. She test drove it and was happy with the van and went forward to purchase it. She wanted to pay cash, but was told it would be cheaper to finance it. Was told if paying cash for any vehicle it was required to pay $799 for the oil change package, which consisted of 10 oil changes. I told the salesman no, that that wasn't going to happen. He went and spoke with his manager and said he can get the oil changes down to $599, which advertised in his office on a piece of paper was the $599 oil change special. They tried to make it seem like they were doing us a favor.

Also what was added on was a $199 paint sealant, 6 applications, each application was put on every 6 months. No, I do not want some monkey running a buffer all over this beautiful van and digging dirt and bird poop into the paint. Was told this is required for EVERY vehicle sold at the dealership. Also what was added on was $299 for tinted windows. They did not tint the windows, it came that way. I call that fraud myself.

We went ahead down to the finance manager's office to sign papers and get it all squared away. He mentioned an extended warranty, showed a brochure to us and said what it covered. Then he put it away and continued on with paperwork. No mention of the price, and neither my grandmother or myself acknowledged ever wanting it. He would slip in a piece of paper, briefly explain what the paper was and she would sign it. Several papers went by, then he sneaked in a $2,540 Platinum Extended warranty that she almost signed. I told him absolutely not, that we did NOT want his extended warranty. he had to shred all the paperwork and start from scratch. 

A few days after this happened, I sent the dealership an email on their website expressing my concerns. I asked that it went to the dealership's manager. I never heard anything back, and neither did my grandmother.

Food -1.5\/5 : honestly nothing special! We got the friend pork chop and it was so dry! We also got the steam eel and It was really not that fresh! We got this vegetable dish and it was super oily as well! 

Atmosphere 1.5\/5 : Nothing special and not especially clean. 

Service 0\/5 : horrible service! First there wasn't that many people in the restaurant, but our food didn't come out till probably almost 30 minutes. All the servers walked around like wandering when trying to get their attention they kind of look past year. One thing that totally ticked me off was when they gave us our bill. Our bill came up to about 58 dollar which is decent. When we gave $70 the person looked at the bill and said ""this isn't enough tip"" (in Mandarin). My Mandarin is a little off and I looked at her she looks at the bill again and said the same thing again. This time I caught what she was saying. I looked at with a ""wtf"" face. Once again she looks at the bill and she turned to us and said ""Oh, sorry I miss read the bill"". In my opinion I do not care if you misread the bill or not you do not comment on how much people tip you. I am one of the most generous tippers, but hate when servers comment on how much people tip to them! I watched the lady that made the rude remarks and she wouldn't bring us our change and handed to a colleague to do it. In my opinion own up to what you did and bring us our change!  

All in all, I am usually willing to give restaurants more than one try, but when it comes to bad and rude service I will never return! This will definitely be my last time visiting this place. My parents and friends will also not be returning! Overall 1\/5 is being generous I feel!

zcMht5VFm9n1RWiphIvFqw,YVccfvHSKu13LqiT1kbR8w,OQcwCyQ53w0rUDdxJXHJfg,1,2014-08-08,"Took a day 'adventure' trip with our two children and ended up near South Blvd.  I had driven by this restaurant many times and thought it would be nice to try.  This was on a Monday, so when we arrived about 8pm, it wasn't very crowded.  The décor is a little over the top, but most steakhouses tend to be that way.  The menu had lots of options, but seemed pricey.  We decided to stay and give it a try.

Out of our group, we ordered 2 steaks.  I ordered a large prime rib to split with my wife and my 8 year-old daughter got the kids sirloin (I would guess It was a 4oz steak).  An hour passed and I had gotten my salad and we had gotten some bread and that was about it.  Finally, after another 10-15 minutes, we got our meals.  My daughter's steak was raw and the prime rib was an end cut and was dry and well done through about half of the cut and then a light pink in the very middle only and overall very dry.  Not the way a prime rib should be cooked.

I proceeded to tell the waitress about the steaks and she offered to bring us 2 more.  I told her we couldn't wait another hour for our steaks and she said she would get them out as soon as possible.  At this point, the manager\/owner came over and told me he thought the prime rib looked fine and he would throw the small sirloin back on the grill.  He also stated that the delay was because they cook the meat to order.  First of all, you don't cook a prime rib to order.  They should already be close to the correct temperature and then finished off as the orders come in.  It was obvious that the piece was cut off an uncooked prime rib that was in the fridge and then put in the oven to cook it quickly and then put on the grill to finish it.  It was cooked and well done on all sides, so there was no cut from the rest of the rib.  My daughter's steak was only 4oz, so how long does that take to cook?  I don't see that it would take an hour for what we ordered, so he tried to tell us something that wasn't true.

The point is that he wanted to argue with me that the prime rib was fine when it was burnt and crusty on the outside and dry on the inside.  He lost that argument as we decided to leave until he handed me a check for a salad, drinks and the side my wife had ordered to go with the prime rib.  Another 15 minutes passed until clearer heads prevailed and the lady at the front told us to not worry about it.

I will never come back when he tried to give us a line about the delays and the quality of the food.  You shouldn't offer something you aren't prepared to present with your best quality.  Cutting the end of a prime rib and trying to make it a prime rib in an hour doesn't work and just frustrates your customers.  Don't lie and just tell the truth.  We would have stayed and tried to enjoy our meal if you just hadn't want to come over and argue with us about our meal.

Poor customer service, overpriced food for the quality and long waits just aren't worth it.  I would avoid this restaurant.",2,1,0

It seemed affordable and looked pretty cool from the outside, plus, anything associated with the awesome High Roller has to be mind blowing...right? Wrong.

I arrived at 10pm on the Thursday before Super Bowl Sunday so things weren't really overcrowded yet. We navigated through the maze they created just to get to the actual hotel entrance, very inconvenient and confusing! Checked the car into valet, checked into the room, everything was cool upon first glance. Room seemed kind of small and the hotel itself looked clean and simple in design, nothing eye popping or memorable honestly. My boyfriend and I were supposed to get dressed quickly to meet friends and go out for the night so we were waiting on our luggage to come up and decided to call down and tell them we were waiting. Problem #1, the handset didn't work so we had to use the phone only on speaker.

Problem #2, our second day there, we hopped in the car to eat off of the strip, when we got back to the hotel no more than 2 hours later, we were told at the valet that they were full and they were only taking Diamond guests...whatever that meant. All I know is we weren't Diamond, we were regular guests and we were rudely told to park ourselves in the parking structure...ummmm ok. So we get to the parking structure where it is utter chaos and cars are darting left and right scouring the tiny four floors for an available spot. We must have driven up and down the structure 3 times before finally finding a spot. We had to literally stalk a couple to their car in order to get it. Let me not forget to add that there's a bunch of parking spaces in the structure designated for employees of the month and there were cones blocking half of each floor. The part that was blocked was completely empty and I really don't understand what they were holding those parking spaces for?

Problem #3, we get to the hotel and all the elevators are out of service. Woops

The next day, we still weren't able to leave our car in valet (""it's super bowl weekend,"" said the valet guy followed by a shrug) and we drove around the parking structure for almost an hour with no luck of finding a space...sounds like something you'd want to do while on a weekend getaway, right? My boyfriend got the bright idea of leaving our car in the High Roller valet which was a 5 minute walk through the Linq promenade where there's restaurants and shopping. Luckily they were more than happy to valet the car. 

I definitely wouldn't stay there again. I thought it would be a great place since the hotel is associated with the High Roller and it is newly renovated. I was expecting something hip and cool like the Cromwell (the common areas, not the room since I haven't actually stayed at the Cromwell yet)...nope. Room was small, sliding bathroom door made things awkward, phone didn't work, valet and parking were practically non existent, elevators didn't work...What's the saying? If you put lipstick on a pig, it's still going to be the Linq Hotel.",2,3,0

The sights and aromas of the food was enough to pique my interest and I wanted to try it all but settled on 3 choices served with chow mien, rice and peas, and other fresh veggies.

We ate half of our meal there and decided to save the rest for later so we didn't get too stuffed and had a nice snack for later on. The hot sauce we were offered was also very delicious, not overtly spicy but really tasty and full of flavor with a nice kick to it.

My wife and I went there last Saturday.  We arrived early at 4:30.  The waitress was taking an order at a large table, 9 people, so we understood she could not be there immediately and waited patiently.
At about 4:45 the server took our order for both drinks and food.  Around 5:00 she finally brought over the drinks, sodas and water, one at a time (I guess she couldn't use both hands).
It was at about this point that we heard the cook and the waitress arguing loudly and then heard the sound of pots and pans being thrown around the kitchen.  Talk about unprofessional!
A few minutes later she finally brought bread to the table of 9, first one basket, then went back for the other.  Inefficient, to say the least.
By 5:15 we began to get a little impatient.  At close to 5:30 we still had no silverware and no soup, salad or bread; that was enough.  We were there for almost a full hour and had nothing but our drinks.
At this point it was time to leave.  My wife approached the waitress and told her to cancel the order, we were leaving.

Now for the food - there are probably no wrong choices on the menu, but after eating here on multiple occasions my advise is: take the sushi boat (a medium one will feed two people with an appetite).

Really great move with JC and Culmer Moving. They did a great job, and JC called several times to check in. They packed and moved our 4-bedroom house. I'll point out that my fiancee didn't show the 3rd floor attic room, but they packed it for us anyway. That took a bunch more time to both pack and move - JC only charged us for going slightly long on moving day, even though it also took 2 hours more to pack than we originally negotiated. In short, we paid ~$200 extra, which was still substantially less than any other estimates we received. Ema and I both agree that in the end we asked them to do a lot more than the original estimate, and JC was more than fair.

Packing was done well. They were up-front about having us decide on a ""safe zone"" that wouldn't be packed. They even set aside a few things (e.g., a very cheap, bendy mirror from Target) and suggested I take it in my car -- it would be a bigger hassle to wrap and put in the truck.

His guys were super friendly, and up-beat and seemed to enjoy helping us out. Since not everything was going to the same place in the new house, they were very careful to ask when bringing things in. They also helped me get a window AC unit in place, which helped us all out on a hot day.

A horrible experience all three times and will never go back. Usually you can get one of three -- great price, terrific quality, or on-time delivery. Well, they struck out all three visits on all three points. And to add insult to injury, the associate with the short dark hair was the antithesis of customer service. She rolls her eyes, speaks with an attitude and tells you that she offers ""great customer service"" when in fact the shoes aren't fixed right at all and she won't make amends. When did the customer's opinion stop counting? Guess she needs to go back to CS school 101. 

Anyways, as several others have commented here, the prices are outrageous -- here are some examples: $45 to glue a sole on, $140 to re-heel and glue, $65 to replace buckles. Now, I'm more than happy to pay high prices if the quality and customer experience are worthy of it -- oh yeah, and if they actually deliver what they promise. On my re-heel job, they promised to replace with black wood stacked heels. When I went to pick them up (they finished the work 3 days late by the way), they gave me brown stacked heels painted black -- on $150 high heels. And they thought they could pull it over to make it even worse. They handed the shoes to me already bagged up and said ""$70 more dollars"" on top of the initial $70 I had paid. When I called them on it, the dark-haired snot got defensive and nasty and rude and obnoxious and a total B*&^H. I will never be back. 

The time before this, I handed over another $95 for them to reheel my dress boots. I have worn them 3x walking around carpeted conference centers for no more than 2 -3 hours on each occasion and the heels are nearly off on both boots.

After my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to ""apologize"". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would ""never salt his steak again"". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it. 

The drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out. 

Overall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.",12,1,0

My beloved cat Pepper, who was my constant companion for the last 2 years, spent last weekend at this Emergency Animal Clinic. Our regular vet told us to bring him here as it was the 24-hour animal hospital closest to our home. It turned out he had a very serious bladder stone condition, and come Monday, when we were able to see our regular vet, we made the heart-breaking decision that putting him down was the best thing to do. 

However, if the staff at this EAC had managed to give us all the information they had, we might have been able to save Pepper a lot of pain and misery sooner and maybe us hundreds if not thousands of dollars. First of all, this place is ghetto. Nothing about the appearance and upkeep inspires any confidence. Secondly, they have rotating doctors and technicians, so you are always talking to someone new. And everyone has a different opinion, and most of them were inconsistent with what our vet told us in the end. The reception area staff was unprofessional. The first girl we spoke to stammered over how to ask when Pepper had last urinated or defecated. Um... how about learning and using appropriate terminology? The person entering my information transposed 2 of the numbers of my cell phone number. No wonder they had to call my husband instead. I verbally corrected it with them over the phone, but when we went in later that day, they still had not changed it on Pepper's  paperwork, so we took out a pen and fixed it ourselves. They neglected to call us when Pepper's urethra blocked yet again within the first 12 hours. They neglected to call us when his temperature spiked again and he became agitated. They said they told my husband the results of his blood tests over the phone, but he does not recall hearing that information. They did let us come see him several times, and while we were waiting to be led back to the cages, we were regaled with loud and stupid personal conversations, that apparently the staff did not care that the rest of us in the waiting room could hear. It just pissed me off that we were all in life-and-death situations and they were all into their petty gossiping. Not that I expect a medical practice to be a somber graveyard, but appropriate conversation at an appropriate volume would simply show respect for the clientele. 

When I told my boss, a fellow cat lover and downtown resident, what happened, she said that she too had once taken a cat to this EAC in an emergency. It was having severe upper respiratory problems, and they were having some trouble getting it out of its carrier. So instead of getting my boss to see if she could coax it out, they tied a rope around its neck. Around the neck of a cat who couldn't breathe. She took the cat somewhere else immediately.

I will also never go here again in an emergency, and have since spoken to a number of people who have given me other options should I find myself in need of immediate after hours care. Our bill (which had to be pre-paid, mind you) was nearly $2000. Outrageous indeed.",26,4,4

Ladies, ladies ladies. One of life's golden rules: Never judge a book by its cover. You only WORK at Christian Louboutin, dears.

On a recent trip to Vegas, I thought I'd treat myself to a couple pairs of shoes. I was specifically looking for a pair of Gloriana flats and a pair of Fifi Botta boots. 

Unfortunately, I didn't find either, but not for want of trying. What I did find were two saleswomen who had just packaged up a bride's shoes and watched her walk out the door and were busily gossiping about her, loudly. 

I had my security detail with me (as I do when I travel). He is a casually dressed, largely built black male. He typically stands a few feet behind me, but his presence is hard to miss in a small shop. While I picked up a dusty Bianca, the saleswomen continued to gossip and glare at my security. After ample time of having looked around the store and NOT being welcomed or spoken to, we left.

My original ramen was very delicious.  The noodles were not overcooked and the broth was intensely flavoured.  My family had the spicy garlic ramen, which had great reviews from them as well.

Usually, I don't comment about the restrooms.  But it's worth commending!  The washroom was nicely interior decorated and has a wide assortment of ""spa"" amenities, like mouthwash and Q-tips.  The mouthwash is perfect after eating the spicy garlic ramen!  :)

I'm from out of town and was in Madison for a busy long weekend, so my second criteria for finding a class was schedule. My first was a class that wasn't hot or really strenuous, and the Friday class I went to (Sage all level with Kristin Sage) was just right for me.

The class wasn't too big, maybe six other people. We started out with the instructor reading a poem, followed by a gentle warm up. For all that most of the people in the class were probably retired, there were some suggested variations that were very difficult. The class ran over by about twenty minutes. Whenever I practice under a new instructor, I struggle a little with the cues and tempo. I periodically struggled with this class, but the instructor was very good both at elaborating the cues and providing quiet corrections. I enjoyed that the class was not silent--the instructor kept up an almost constant stream of description and encouragement.

The space was airy, with some plants in the corners. If the class had been silent, the construction next door might have been a little disruptive, but it just added a bit of spice to the balance postures.

I hope to be able to make it back next time I am in town.",1,0,0

Leasing office staff is great\/nice.  Not so helpful, but nice.

Management, unresponsive, uninformed, unhelpful (I am being polite).

If you are idiotic enough to be sucked into living here, live on the 2nd floor.  When I have mentioned to the leasing office about the noise, their response has been ""just try to make friends with them"" or ""that is just the way the buildings are constructed.""

Fireplace units do not have the chimneys cleaned.

Dead roach in the kitchen upon move in.

Carpet\/pad so thin that you quickly and painfully learn to avoid stepping where there are tack strips.  

Multiple safety concerns: homeless, attempted break-ins, theft of rent checks, lighting not maintained\/replaced, holes in the ground (where there is a water overflow or whatever pipe) has not had a lid on it for months.  Management has been made aware on several occassions -- still not fixed. 

Oh, and with regard to the burglaries and break-ins.....the management does not inform the tenants.  At all.  Never.  Ever.  So you may never know that your upstairs neighbors had an attempted break in (when you were home).

Maintenance appointments not kept -- and they do not typically leave notes when they do enter your apartment (even though they are supposed to).

No package service -- website says they will accept packages.

And if you ask about the ""pre-wired for security"" they have no idea what you are talking about.

Do not forget the FBR open....I work at Keirland Commons area -- during the FBR my commute was at least 35 minutes....no kidding.

After living at Presley for a year, I can honestly say it is the most overpriced apartment I have ever resided, and I have lived in Manhattan, so that is really saying something. The noise you hear in the apartment is outrageous. I could hear my next door neighbors conversations in Chinese, my downstairs neighbors various sexcapades, and to really cap it off, my upstairs neighbor was a flautist with the Charlotte Symphony, so I had to listen to him practice for hours every day. If your apartment faces the pool, make sure that you are okay with crappy techno blasting all summer from 12 PM to 12 AM. When I complained to the Assistant Manager downstairs she started complaining that I was complaining!

The staff is another issue. Presley only seems to hire attractive young women with no career experience. Staff is completely lacking any customer service training, and are totally bratty to anyone who comes forward with any suggestions or concerns. Every response is dripping with condescension, while the written letters and emails are chock full of grammatical errors. 

The amenities are super nice, when they are functioning. Something in the gym is always broken, and there is frequently dog excrement in the common outdoor areas, and even in the carpeted hallways. 

The least bothersome problem for me, which bothered other tenants a lot, is that the hallways always reek of marijuana. Not like, ""Oh, is that marijuana I smell?"" but rather, ""Crap, I hope they don't drug test me at work because I am definitely getting a sweet contact high!"" It is intense.

Overall, the Presley should not charge more than $800 for a studio, $1000 for a 1 BD, and $1200 for a 2 BD. But as long as they can get away with it, they will provide the lowest quality service with the highest possible rates.",2,2,1

This college treats employees horribly and violate employee and students rights everyday. You're better off being arrested by Iraqi police then their officers. I worked for this department for a year and their chief ignores students being extorted. Officers are ordered to ticket students for anything. Employees get free passes. Most students struggle financially yet teachers can do whatever including criminal acts. 

MCCCD is known to be wasteful and irresponsible in spending. They raise tuition every year and pay certain employees just absurd salaries. For example there are patrol cops there making 60-70 a year. What??? That is ridiculous. The real cops patrolling the streets of Glendale don't get close to that. They also built a full public safety building in Tempe. Why? It's such a small department. No need for it. All the campuses have two brand new patrol cars. Why? As of last year the officers can't even arrest unless they turn them over to local police. We spend millions on officers that can't do anything and have zero authority. Local police do everything anyway. ABC 15 did an investigative report on this already.

Dora here. What a massive, eclectic shopping center! Restaurants, boutiques, salon, spa...even a Target and Harris Teeter. I could happily lose myself in here for days. 

This restaurant offers fresh seafood in a casual dining environment with an outside patio. Now, if you follow our blog much, you know it is not too often that I can talk my wife into experiencing a seafood restaurant, but it was Father's Day, so what could she say.

Dora here. Anything for you, honey.

We ordered a side of Corn Fritters as an appetizer. Served with a dose of powdered sugar, these fritters were crusty (Dora here. I told him he couldn't use the word ""crispy"" again today, and this is what he comes up with, lol) on the outside and soft on the inside with nuggets of fresh corn and red pepper. The fritters were great but I missed a dipping sauce to be enjoyed while eating them.

Dora here. YUM! These babies were fluffy and light, with occasional glimmers of corn and red pepper flecks. The touch of sweet from the powdered sugar made us debate whether they tasted more savory than sweet. Great start to our meal! Don't they look delicious?

I chose the New England Lobster Roll with a side of homemade chips and a cup of seafood gumbo. Now I know you will say that is a lot of seafood, but when you do not get it too often, you have to load up on it when you get a chance. (Dora here. Haha.) The lobster roll was creamy, tender and tasty, and served on a grilled roll capable of handling this full-bodied sandwich. Outstanding!

The gumbo was packed with rice, sausage, beans, shrimp, and some other ingredients that I could not identify because I devoured it too fast. Hardy flavor and just the right amount of heat. Another thumbs up!

Dora here. Take a gander at the Crab Sandwich. Yowza! What's not to love about a buttery soft bun barely containing all that crabilicious flavor? The broccoli slaw wasn't mayo based, so I used it as another condiment for my sandwich, which added another texture and layer of flavors. Delicious! And I'm not a fan of tomatoes, but those super tiny maters on this sandwich were so fresh and sweet, I ate every one of them! Just don't tell my mother. lol

Corporate greed once again corporate greed.  Just like the gentlemen at the check-in counter told me Vegas is geared for corporate events and no longer a family destination. How right he is.

The resort fee is approximately $40 a night per room and they will not waive it don't ask you're wasting your time.  For four nights I paid an additional $210 approximately on top of my hotel room.  Mr. CEO desert sand is free go eat some.  Corporate greed is pushing working families away from Vegas dot be fooled. Furthermore, the Buffett is quite expensive, however, it's worth the price. The only draw back is you enter your phone number into a kiosk tells you that you'll be texted as to when to come back to be seated or so I thought. After waiting over an hour I was texted, but I realized once I got there I had to wait an additional thirty plus minutes after being texted in line.

I must give El Valle kudos and a higher rating this time around, as we had an exceptional experience.  I honestly couldn't remember our last visit, but I'm glad we returned.  

The menu is quite extensive.  It took awhile to review it entirely.  And I found a lot of different choices than a lot of Mexican restaurants offer, which was a nice surprise.  All at fantastic prices, with an average of about $10 a person.  I finally decided on Camarones El Loco, which is described as ""shrimp in a special burning hot chipotle sauce, served with rice and beans.""  What intrigued me most was the ""burning hot"" sauce.  While it didn't seem ""burning hot"" to me (sadly), it certainly was delicious and came with a lot of shrimp.  It was a creamy sauce without much kick.  Bonus: all the sauce doubled as a sauce for the rice.  I didn't even use the tortillas that were brought with the meal; it was all good and filling on its own.

One of our friends ordered one of the soups that she's ordered before, proclaiming its size enormous.  She ordered the small bowl, which is much bigger than other restaurants' small size.  And she was right.  It was a huge-portioned, very chunky soup, stuffed with a lot of goodness.  It's a meal in itself.

We all left the restaurant fat and happy.  My opinion of El Valle has been changed...for the better!  They have fantastic food at excellent prices.

I ordered the chicken panang, which is the first thing I have at any Thai restaurant.  I implored them to make it as spicy as possible.  When I got it I was pretty shocked.  It was sufficiently creamy, but there wasn't a single pepper in the dish.  Essentially they had added a bunch of dried chili flakes, but they weren't spicy at all.  It ended up being about a 2\/10 on my scale in terms of spice.  More than that, though, it was disgusting.  It didn't taste like panang at all, the chicken was of mediocre quality, and there were large pieces of what seemed like cabbage in the panang -- something I've never seen any place else.

UPDATE: I picked up my car today and they do an excellent job. Yes, waiting for the service guy at the start is a little annoying but they do such a good job, they deserve 5 stars.

-----------------------------------

I have been to this service department several times with two of my VW's. Generally, the service is quite good. The service reps are friendly and attentive (when you get their attention - see below). I plan to keep returning to them to service my VW.

My only complaint and the reason I give it four stars is because of the way you make first contact with a service person. You drive up and there are a series of ""booths"" next to the drive up alley. Almost every time, I have to stand around waiting for someone to come out and start the service process. You pull up, get out of your car and basically stand around  for 5-15 minutes. I understand if the service guys are working with another person but they are often on the phone inside their booth and don't acknowledge you for quite some time. There have been times when one of the guys is in the booth and not on the phone so you end up sliding the door open and doing the ""Excuse me"" to get attention. Just a little awkward and slow. Be ready to deal with waiting to get some attention.

However, once you have their attention, everything tends to go quite well. I have even had a service guy point out something that was wrong that I didn't even notice, then fixed it under warranty.

As for the people that complain about wait time when you actually choose to wait... I always assume that I might wait beyond the estimated wait time. It seems to be the nature of the business when you go to a dealership for service (as opposed to a ""Jiffy Lube"" for example). If they say 2 hours, I am usually prepared for 2 1\/2 and happily surprised if it's less. Bring something to do though because their waiting room isn't particularly entertaining itself. If I remember correctly, they have free WiFi (don't hold me to that, not sure).

I'll keep going back. I just expect the awkward start to my service experience. No big deal.",2,2,0

Where do I start? 

We put in a reservation for 7pm. Upon arriving, there was no one there to greet us. A manager across the lobby stared at us while we wandered back and forth looking for the restaurant. Around the corner, we had to walk through a group of hotel guests who were eating at a free lunch buffet. When someone finally asked us if we were eating at the restaurant, they said ""let us set up a table for you"". Umm... what happened to the reservation?

We sit down in a brightly lit space. The entire area felt cheap and un-decorated. No big deal, lets hope the food and service are good... nope.

The waiter was nice, but had NO CLUE what he was doing. It took forever for him to come to are table, which was strange because there was only one other table seated in the whole place. Then he took our food order, and said he would be back for drink and appetizer orders... wtf? Did I mention that the menu had chicken quesadillas as a random appetizer? That should have been our first clue... Then the waiter brought half frozen, cheap white bread to the table with a lump of butter on top of all the bread. I was more confused than anything.

We got up and left because after all of that misery, we STILL hadn't gotten drinks. No way was I going to drop 40 bucks on a filet from a place like this. One of our group spoke to the manager, and she gave us some bullshit spiel about how sorry she was. 

Went to a different restaurant and had a normal, tasty meal. This place needs to close, hire and train all new staff, redecorate, re-do the menu, and just generally get its shit together if they want any chance of success.

My ""check engine"" dash light was on.  Auto Zone (the good guys) checked the codes and found I had some evaporative leaks. I took that report to my mechanic who recommended I get a ""smoke test"" at Pep Boys in Tempe to pin down the leaks.  I had the $89 test done and Pep Boys prepared an estimate of allegedly necessary repairs that came to just under $900.  Auto Zone had already priced out the parts they expected would be implicated. The parts themselves weren't expensive at Auto Zone (I wound up spending $140 for parts there.) I took those parts to my mechanic who installed them while I watched in fewer than 20 minutes and charged me $40.00 for labor. The dash light went off, Auto Zone confirmed I had no codes and I breezed through inspection and the DMV.   

I spent $140 for parts, $40 for labor and $89. for the smoke test for a total of $270.  Pep Boys wanted $870. from me for the same repairs, plus one I didnt need involving the fuel pump.  The point of the smoke test was to discover the source of actual leaks but Pep Boys decided my fuel pump must also be leaking (when it wasn't.)

When I confronted Joel at Pep Boys he said pricing was determined by the corporate office and defended the estimate of $530.79 in labor, the $201.37 in parts and the $109.94 for ""other"" in addition to the $89.00 I paid separately for the smoke test (which I would not have had to pay if I had agreed to the $870.00 in work. Gee, thanks guys.) I'm sure I'm not the only customer given a vastly inflated estimate so I would strongly suggest getting a second and third opinion before allowing Pep Boys to do any work on your car.",0,0,0

When we talked in, the place didn't the seem crowded at all. The place was dimly lit with ponds full of water and rose petals. Quite nice. The restaurant was actually huge andbreally crowded upin walking further in. We were greeted by a very friendly staff and quickly seated. 

Since I both weren't too hungry due to going for dessert before hand at Serendipity, we just ordered the duck fried rice and chow mein noodles. They were both delicious and extremely filling. The ingredients were fresh and although the food was greasy, it didn't make me feel all disgusting like most restaurants. The rice was my favorite. Tons of duck meat and vegetables. The noodles weren't bad at all, but nothing too special. 

Although the food was quite delicious, my favorite thing about Tao was the atmosphere. The Buddhist theme was present throughout the restaurant. There was a huge Buddha statue in the middle of the restaurant with other Buddhist statues along the walls and pillars. Even the table set up was awesome. I loved the entrance and the lighting. 

When I return to Vegas, I will definitely come back here with much more of an appetite. The other dishes looked amazing as well.",0,0,1

A few notes to keep in mind:

* If you are staying at the Westin, the spa facility is open to 8pm.  Go get a workout down in their fitness area and come here to freshen up.

* The steam room takes time to start up, but once it's activated you'd think you were in fog city (Daly City to those who catch my drift).  

* There's free flowing Tazo teas, fruit juices, orange flavored chocolates, and samples of Biore and Intuition shavers waiting for you.  

* 20% is automatically added to spa treatments to cover gratuity, and they don't ask if you want to add more.

* Lockers are narrow, so pack your necessary toiletries and make-up and that's it.

* Pool and jacuzzi are just around the corner from the spa and up the ramp.

My 11 and 15 year old went also and they had a great time. We went back the following day to hike Red Rock (Ice Box Canyon trail-- great hike!).
We left on the Scooters (149cc) around 8:30am and were back by 11:30am. The 3 hour tour consists of a few miles of suburban roads followed by a drive into Red Rock Canyon on a road where you drive in the bike lane IF there are cars approaching behind you. The guides do a good job of blocking off traffic to keep the group safe.
The total trip was about 25 or 26 miles. There are many twists and turns, uphills and downhills in the park, which are perfect for this type of scooter. On the open stretches, you'll get up to about 40-45 mph. As everyone mentions, there are 4 stops: one at the visitor center for restroom break (they gave us about 20 minutes there). The first stop after the visitor center (I think it's called Calico) is the best one by far...get out and go up the rock trail for great views of the Red Rocks. Again, about 20 minutes. The next two stops were nothing more than a quick photo opportunity. The highlight is cruising through such a serene and beautiful park in an open air scooter type thing. I have a scooter at home, and this park is truly the perfect setting for a ride!!",0,0,1

Nothing came in it as stated on the menu. Our waitress was too busy talking about going back to school with another table to notice that we needed drinks or a salad maybe? Upon her arrival I asked for my salad to go and some crushed red pepper for my flavorless noodles. She brings back the jar of crushed red with some dust and hair stuck to the bottom of it. Needless to say I did not use it or finish my plate. After waiting another 20 min for the check we decided to take it upon ourselves to go to the cashier.

They serve deep fried crunchy tacos, which are greasy (obviously) but delicious. The soft tacos are larger than the traditional street tacos, 2-3 of those should fill you up.  I personally like the carne adobada plate- marinated beef served with choice of flour or corn tortillas. The flour tortilla is really large! It's a tasty alternative to your typical taco shop fare. 

As most tacos shops, you order at the counter and self serve salsa and pick up order at the counter when called. Available salsas are red and green as one would suspect.  

As others have mentioned, there is a drive through, although it could be time consuming as it usually takes 5-10 minutes for them to prepare your food. If others are ahead of you this might be time prohibitive. It's likely faster to order inside rather than drive-thru. I usually go on my lunch hour.

This is as good as it gets for a true foodie, and the view and ambiance just add to the great experience. Couple of suggestions: if you go as a group of 4 or more, order a bunch of aps, salads and throw in a few micro pizzas (but pass on mortadella pizza, it was only average), every item offers a different taste, one as good as the next. Then pick a pasta to share, the portion size will be relatively small, but good to share as you still need to get to the main course. We had the pasta in a light sauce with 2 jumbo shrimp, I think it is her signature pasta, it is heavenly, and the T-bone is cut into slices at the table and it is one of the largest cuts of beef I've ever seen served, should be shared by the whole table. Throw a fish dish in, and you have it pretty well covered, but leave room for a bite of dessert, they are all excellent. Top end wine list, recommend those in the Rioja section.

I ordered dosa and madras coffee. The coffee came before the dosa. I requested the server to give the coffee a little later as it would get cold before the dosa would even arrive.

I saw online that this was the place to go to sell your phone. And I did. I got $90 cash for my Sprint S3. Fast forward to this evening when I came in wanting to sell my S4. ""No we don't take Sprint phones."" The guy wouldn't accept the phone in near mint condition. I told him how I sold my S3 just months earlier and he said the guy who looks at Sprint devices doesn't work weekends and that I'd have to come back on Monday. Funny how when I sold my S3 it was the weekend. I then call back on my way home and ask again about if they take Sprint phones on trade and he says oh we only take T-Mobile and AT&T. Double talk this place. Smoke in mirrors. Pathetic.",0,0,0

The mushrooms are genetically modified to only have the visual appearance of a 'mushroom'. On the only non-negative note, the crust around the perimeter was passable: firm, floury, not soggy or greasy.

The hotel itself itself is fine, so long as you have no intention of interacting with staff anywhere on the premises and book directly through their site.

I'd been here on numerous occasions for events and conventions and dealt with crappy service on multiple levels, but its not a bad property or downtown location so I considered booking it on the fly through a third party site.

The date was a month in advance and when I was tired I hit a command for back that lead me to book instead of modify the date. I accepted my lack of availability to further search\/debate and went to check in only to find the error and the hotel being full. Was what it was and I'll take some blame. 

The employee at the front said she'd make a note and told me I'd just to call and wait potentially up to 3 weeks for the credit to hit. No credit was issued and the manager tried to claim I stayed after I had to bring the matter to my bank...months after my last visit to Arizona.

The experience I had was terrible, I went to French Style Dry cleaners to get my Blazer and blue chino pants to get tailored and altered. Came on a Saturday morning and had to wait in the front desk for about 2 mins as I patiently watched them talking in the back. The people were nice, but the business was the WORST! I asked to get my pants and jacket tailored, and they measured and pinned it up to how i wanted it to fit and they did so. After giving them the clothes they wrote down three things that i would be charged with but didn't put how much i would be charged. The only thing it said was that its $10 with the hemming alone. I asked how much the total cost of the tapered blazer and pants would be, and the lady told me that they would have to ask the lady who's doing the tailoring for them. So they told me that they would call me the next day to inform me about the prices, but they never did. So I called them on Monday, which was the day after they were suppose to call me, asking if they found out about the prices, the lady didn't understand my question at first and thought i asked her if my clothes were ready to get picked up and she told me they were ready to get picked up. Which i was surprised cause they didn't even call me about it cause i had to call them myself to see if it was done or not. But that's not the bad part, i asked about the prices and they told me it was $40 tapered the blazer + $16 tapering the pants + $10 hemming the pants = with a total of $66 all together. ARE YOU SERIOUS, i understand the pricing for the tapered pants and the hemming but $40 alone to taper the blazer!?! That is pathetic! Other places average about $20 to tailor the blazer alone!

We booked our room over 3 weeks prior to our stay. We booked a room in the Palace Tower that was supposed to have couches and overlooking the pools just as our previous stay. We asked for early check in. When we arrived about 1 pm we were told no rooms were ready yet. They took our cell number and would call. At nearly 5 pmwe went back to check on our room. They assigned us a room. When we got into it the room was NOT the large room as requested when booking. At that time we had a dinner engagement.  Went to from desk next morning at 7 am and politely asked about it. The lady at the front desk was so rude. We told her it was our wedding stay and we just wanted theroom we paid for. She told my husband..oh just go buy her a purse! She did not care at all. 

At the bar across from the front desk the blond male bartender was worse than rude to our party of 8. He insisted they were out of Makers Mark and Jack Daniels. There were plenty of both on the shelf above the bar at the other end.

The concierge was rude when we asked about ordering extra flowers.

While trying to negotiate a car down from the internet (Autotrader) price, I was informed from the 'finance' manager that the online advertised price of $13,995 was simply a ""marketing strategy"" so that he could say on the radio (Johnjay and Rich) that he was selling 2016 Fusions for that price. Once we began negotiating the total price after 'fees' and taxes was almost $21,000. More than 50% over the online price. He went on to explain that they had paid $13,995 at auction just a few days earlier when he bought over 40 cars and could not sell the car for that amount. He then asked what I wanted in a monthly price, to which I said monthly price was not my concern, total price was. He basically told me that I was wrong to think like that, and that everyone is more interested in the monthly.
We walked out.
Needless to say, I didn't buy anything from this 'bait and switch' shady dealer.

Not only does their ""24\/7"" only work from 9-5 m-f they barely could care less if they solve the problem. I had to go to the better business bureau to finally  solve a hanging laggy internet problem. Even the BBB couldn't get a response for about 3 months. 

When it did go through I got finally a glimmer of hope in a great technician named John as he solved most of my internet problems regarding bad cables. 
John solved my problems temporarily but it's clear that this stellar Lieutenant on the front line cannot solve the inadequacies and leaks that stem from poor system design and just a lackluster UX. (if they even care about the end user at all)

However no technician no matter his professionalism and great candor can stop Cox's sh**** customer service, or the fact that our internet goes to sh** when high traffic hours come on.

Cox is passable when you don't have issues. When one starts however, you can clearly see the cracks in their structure. My identity was stolen and a payment on my internet bill bounced due to Wells Fargo closing my account down to prevent further theft. I explained this to their CSR reps and still I have oodles of strange and weird charges on my bill. I mean why is their 2 charges for credit card and e-check denials on top of credit adjustment above it? Isn't that a little redundant to fix a charge and then charge me back for the charge I was credited back? There's a mountain of () and #'s that would make a license CPA want to scream.

Even better is their automated voice system when you call in that makes you go through loopholes only to make sure to remind you at the end of their maze that they are closed. 24 hours customer service my brownie butt.  Shouldn't 1 call fix this relatively small problem instead of having to call back and check if ""Cox"" is ready for you? 

Oh yea I bought a new modem and router thanks to their whizes at their in store locations which is like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. You can improve your end but the likelihood that Cox holds up theirs is doubtful and will remain so until the USA changes legislation that makes ISP standard what the Asians in Korea, Japan, hell even China have today.

I want to talk to the system engineers and upper management of cox? What is the business vision of cox? To spread the corporate love of a company that survives by a cartel business structure and not one of true democracy? The CEO of Cox should really contemplate where his ship is going and look deep down if he wants to be the caretaker of a customer service\/business model that most Cash-Advance Loan Sharks wouldn't touch

It's digusting that the only other option in my neighborhood is cox or shaky looking century link dsl connection.    

So yeah if you have 99 problems and your downright darius about becoming a centurion go ahead and sign Cox up as your ISP provider.",8,7,1

The bartender was very nice, she made the best Litchi martini i ever tried.
She took our appetizer order while we were waiting (about 20min) so when we got the table
we didn't have to wait for the food which was great because we were starving.
All six of us agreed that the food was amazing, as well as the presentation.

From fancy occasion dresses, pretty tops and spot-on jewelry to casual wear, cozy sweaters and cool-looking yet functional shoes, Evie Lou is chock full of obscure designer names with something for all.  you won't see many of these pieces anywhere else, and 9 out of 10 times, you won't get the fantastic above-and-beyond customer service and very positive vibes throughout your shopping experience that you get here.",0,0,0

We didn't know what to expect. The staff is amazing and the servers are very funny, making a train in the dark to go to the restroom and to make it to our table was quite the experience. My friend had the orange and ginger chicken with buttered green cabbage and the pear profiterole with chocolate sauce; while I had the lamb shank, braised in red wine, with tomatoes and mushrooms served with cauliflower and potatoes, and for dessert I had Onoir's chocolate mouse with orange glaze and cookie crumbles. The food was amazing, the wine was good, eating in complete darkness was challenging but super-fun. We were shocked we didn't spill the wine and got food all over our shirts.

I placed my order, was treated lovely by the young ladies taking the orders\/money.

Then the waiting happened....15 minutes went by and the other 3 cars were given their food, which all included large boxes of chicken, the same basic thing I had ordered.  The funny thing was, two of those orders were brought to my car first, and when the young lady asked me my order # I told and both times she responded, ""Oh, yours is coming out next.""

I asked the same young man if he could just fill my order with the chicken that was right in front of him.

I hardly ever write negative reviews because I am a very ""forgiving"" customer. However this was one of the worst experiences ever.

Let me start off by saying the atmosphere was very lively and upbeat which was great.  This was our first time going to this place so I didn't have any preconceived notions about it. This was not just a dinner but this was a celebration dinner for my husband. I made reservations for 19 almost a week before the date of the dinner. I was told that this wouldn't be a problem and to confirm my appt the day before. I actually spoke with about 3 different ppl during that week and everyone still said everything was fine. 

When I got to the restaurant with my party we walked back to our table and it was 2 separate tables with our backs to the next table. If you have ever booked a dinner for family and friends, you would assume that you are all sitting together. Immediately I asked the waiter to see what can be done about this as I couldn't believe no one thought to tell me. The waiter said there was nothing he could do so of course I went straight to the manager. The arrogance and horrible attitude that I encountered was disgusting!!! I asked if they could please try and move tables around or accommodate us as this was a reservation that was held for almost a week. He didn't even try and said no there's nothing he can do. I asked him why I wasn't told this and he said ""we do not have to disclose that."" I literally couldn't believe that we were bringing them that much business and they treated me like I was walking in off the streets. 

I had to walk away from him as I could feel my blood pressure rising. A family friend went up to him and kept trying to get this worked out and needless to say he wouldn't even apologize. He then stated that he would give us champagne and desserts on the house. He never once came over to the table to apologize or even check on us. They kept saying there was no way to move the tables yet we thought of a TON of ways to get all of us together. 

The dirty looks and rolling of the eyes by the manager and certain staff members was unacceptable to me. The sad thing is that the food was pretty good but because of the horrible service that we received, I would never step foot in this place. Others in the large party said the same thing as they couldn't believe the horrible treatment we received. 

I have been to many restaurants around the world and I know what good food and service feels like. This was below average by far. If you are wanting to plan a large party or dinner with this place-RUN! It was a nightmare...",2,0,1

Forewarning - you're going to see heavy usage of the word intense 

Veggie Tasting Menu w\/ the ""Premium"" Wine Paring 

* 3 Melon salad - huge shavings of Honeydew, Cantaloupe, & teeny little balls of cucumber w\/ slivers of Jalapeno & drizzled in Olive Oil 

* Asparagus Soup w\/ Tomato Dumplings & Mushrooms - those dumplings were OMG gasp-provoking - intensely flavored w\/ tomato & when paired w\/ the equally intense flavor of the asparagus - wow!  Also had little mushrooms & roasted tomatoes in the middle of the soup so lots of yummy flavors to mix & match. This was 1 of my favs 

* Artichoke Souffle w\/ Parmesan sauce - so smooth, rich & intense w\/ artichoke flavor; not eggy at all & cooked just perfectly. This was 1 of my favs 

* Ricotta Truffle Fettuccine - teeny tiny carrots, green beans, and these absolutely incredibly tasty large brown beans (don't know what they were) are nestled in long-as-your-arm, hand-rolled fettuccine noodles. Huge flavors of truffle!! 

* Cherry Semolina Cake w\/ Sherry-infused Ice Cream - moist semolina cake w\/ marinated cherries and an intensely-flavored Sherry Ice Cream. Light dessert which topped off the meal just perfectly 

* Amuse Bouche was Goat Cheese Panna Cotta w\/ Tomato Gelee. We didn't get to try this dish b\/c Panna Cotta is usually made from gelatin & those of us in the veggie world know gelatin is a no-no. Our waiter was so kind & apologetic & he had the chef make us a special Amuse Bouche of Melon & Tomatoes which was so nice! 

But he then came over later to tell us upon further research, he uncovered the gelatin they use for the Panna Cotta was actually made out of Agar so it was completely Veggie-friendly!  He said they make it a special point to design all their Amuses so that everyone can enjoy.....they take care to incorporate the Veggie and Allergy people - so no animal, shellfish or nuts go into the Amuses 

HOW AWESOME IS THAT?! 

Service was incredible & everyone was so friendly - immediately asked if we were on a timetable (which we were!) so they could get us out & on our way - explained each dish as it was delivered & how it was made; asked if we liked it; The Sommelier explained each wine, where it came from & the vintage & came back to ask if we liked it.....it was true 5-star treatment

While I was surprised to see such short-term availability, I was hopeful that I could've finally found ""the one"" to cut my hair in Vegas (nice salons are few and far between here). Following my booking, which required me to put down a credit card, I received one confirmation text message and then an additional reminder text message.

I left my office right at 5PM (a rarity) to ensure that I would not be tardy for my appointment with Cesar. I have done communication work for a salon in Central Los Angeles and understand how much added stress ensues when a client in just 5 minutes late to an appointment. Once I arrived at Town Square, I promptly reported to LOOK for my first experience at the salon. 

While I was somewhat impressed with the aesthetic and feel of the salon, I was quickly disappointed to learn that Cesar was gone for the day. While my appointment had been booked, and confirmed no one in the salon had thought to call, text, or email me. 

The receptionist, who was sweet but without any skill to resolve the situation, suggested that I return to the salon on another day to see Cesar. A funny thought when you consider that I wasted nearly an hour of my evening trying to see Cesar for the appointment that I had booked and confirmed. How is one to know if Cesar will be available during his ""availability"" another day?

My suggestion for clients? Call to book. 

My suggestion for the salon? COMMUNICATE. This situation could've easily been avoided. If you're going to have stylist availability and booking online, COMMUNICATE with stylists to ensure that stylists are actually available to execute said services. If there is an issue with an appointment, utilize your receptionist to COMMUNICATE to the client. Work as a TEAM. Where was Cesar during all of this? Did he not receive immediate notification of my booking? If Cesar was gone for the day all he needed to do was COMMUNICATE the receptionist so she could then COMMUNICATE to the client.

This place is just awful.  The Orange Chicken tastes bland, overcooked, and, despite feeling starved, has been thrown in the trash.

My coworker's General Tso's Chicken does not look better and apparently doesn't taste it either.

What I love most is that I waited an hour and a half for the food and shelled out $23 between me and one co-worker (we didn't even order drinks...).  The gentleman on the phone barked orders at me to the point where I wasn't even mad, just confused.

We did the chess room with a groupon and were not impressed at all.  I bought the groupon before really looking at the room options, and then the only one that worked with my schedule was the chess room.  I don't know a lot about chess, but we decided to give it a shot.  As it turns out, the chess room is indeed all about chess.  So, if you don't know how to play chess, this is not the room for you.  

That part aside, this place is yucky and uninspired.  The whole place has a dingy feel to it.  There's debris on the floor in the hallway, bags of trash everywhere, and the bathroom was not clean at all.  They did a quick intro of ""don't destroy the room"" and then we were off.  The room was sparse.  Really sparse.  There were three pieces of furniture and little else.  Certainly not enough to keep 8 people busy at once.  Some of the clues were clever, but others were so obscure that we were lost without hints.  The room was well worn and the clues were too - one puzzle was so worn that we could barely put it together.  All in all, we needed MANY clues and still didn't finish.  

At the end of the day, my impression of this place is this:  A couple of people had a few beers and said ""hey, escape rooms are popular - let's do that"" and then they made a cheap, halfhearted attempt to put one together.  Skip this and try another brand.",5,2,1

This is a second review, ( 9\/8\/17) I ordered through Postmates to get delivery. I have ordered the stuff on curry bowl in the past and really enjoyed it. This time however, it was terrible. It was completely bland yet overwhelmingly spicy at the same time, the noodles were undercooked , dried out, and had zero flavor, almost as if they didn't season it whatsoever. There were also about a pound of jalapeños in it, both raw and cooked and it was so overly spicy it was inedible. I'm extremely disappointed because I know the potential of this place but sad to say I probably won't order from here again.

Eventually, I received a letter from this practice that my physician was no longer with them.  It was such a cold letter that all I can assume is the physician quit or was fired. 
I did hear from friends of that physician that the lack of assistance, lack of receiving messages and general problems there made this Doctor quit one day.  I guess even the Doctor I was using just had enough one day--and I totally understand that one considering my experience. 
Regardless, I decided I could no longer tolerate not being able to reach the physician when I had a question and changed Doctors--and I am a healthy person that would only call in an emergency.

Here is where the fun begins:
I called 3X to get my records sent over after I went to my new physician and signed the release.  Nothing came.  Then I went to the new physician about 6 months later since nothing had ever come (and luckily I hadn't gotten ill and needed them) and signed a new release so the physician could go over IN PERSON and pick up my records.
Now, this would not be so bad except I spoke with the Supervisor of the Medical Records room myself on this third call I made to have my records sent, and she assured me they would be at my new physician's at the end of the next day.  Again, nothing came.
Bottom line:  It was just about a whole YEAR before my records got to my new physician, and that was because she finally just went over to that office and picked them up personally.  How sad a situation is that one?  It was a first time for me to hear anything like that ever.
This place is so disorganized and uncaring that I would never ever recommend anyone use this facility.

Das das Gospelforum wie viele andere evangelische Freikirchen auf der Welt versuchen, die Bibel zu leben und den Gottesdienst so zu gestalten, das man Gott wirklich persönlich begegnen und erfahren kann, finde ich sehr positiv.
Und wenn Jesus wie damals heute noch heilt oder Freude in der Trauer oder Frieden in ein unruhiges Herz schenkt, fände ich es eher falsch, das Aussenstehenden vorzuenthalten.
Das das vielleicht für dich nicht das das Richtige ist oder wenn du es eher traditioneller, förmlicher oder unemotionaler magst ist ebenfalls total in Ordnung. Das wäre eher nichts für mich und ich fühle mich z.B. gerade deshalb im Gospelforum pudelwohl. Jeder braucht seinen Stil\/Art von Kirche, durch die er zu einer persönlichen Beziehung mit Jesus findet  egal ob Landeskirche, Baptisten, Pfingstgemeinde usw. oder eine charismatische Gemeinde wie das Gospelforum. wobei ich das Gospelforum eher bei den gemäßigten charismatisch\/ evangelischen Freikirchen einzuordnen würde.

We are having heating problems but our landlord claims there is no issue. We wanted to pay someone to come and out and service the unit. When I told the person that answered the phone that the owner had a home warranty, she told me to find out the name of the home warranty company and to find a company that works with them because ASI doesn't participate with any home warranty program. Well my husband called today to make an appointment, and was told that not only could they not service the unit without the owner's permission, but that they could not even step foot on the property. I don't believe that for a moment! It seems to me that all they are concerned about is not getting the business of a replacement unit, if the unit needs to be replaced.

All I wanted was to get someone out to check the unit because I don't trust that the company sent by the home warranty company did a good job, because our house is still cold and the unit is only blowing lukewarm air. I wanted a company with good reviews to come out, but they have basically refused to help us.  But that's okay--I have news for them.

Additional comments made to this business on 2\/5\/16: 

Mr. Itzhak D., I appreciate your arguments; however, your comments seem to indicate that you believe that tenants have no rights when it comes to a property that they are renting. That could not be further from the truth. Under Nevada law, if a landlord fails to remedy an issue, such as heating problems, within a reasonable amount of time after being notified of the issue, a tenant may call someone qualified to repair the issue and charge the costs of the repair back to the landlord. I have already preceded with the steps required under the law, and by your refusal to provide service to me, you are preventing me from exercising MY RIGHTS as a tenant, which is fine--it's your business and your choice. But you must realize that I was considering your company to provide maintenance services on my new home, but your actions, or rather refusal to act has now eliminated you from any further consideration.",7,5,0

My husband purchased a VOICE daily deal for one of my Christmas gifts & I had to call for 3 days in a row to get someone to call me back.  When he finally did call back he said they were overwhelmed with the daily deals and would be able to schedule for the following month (June 23, 2012).  I set the date & called the day before with no answer and no call back....big surprise!  They called my husband (not me, even though I was the one who left the message) the day they were supposed to arrive & said they got behind and asked if they could reschedule to either later in the day or the next day.  He rescheduled for the next day between 12-2pm & low and behold, they didn't show up & no phone call was made to us.

You can walk or take the tram to so many hotels from this location and the new tower rooms are quite nice.  Very solid Mattresses.  This place is great and a great price point in Vegas.

But since the top puzzle was a complete set I figured the bottom peice would be too. And there was no way of me looking if all the prices were there on the bottom puzzle unless I opened the bag. Anyways I bought the bag for 3 dollars. Went home to play with my son and when I opened the bag and looked at the second puzzle, it was missing two pieces( and the puzzle only had a total of ten prices). I mean come on!!! Why would anyone bag up an incomplete puzzle and sell it for 3 dollars?! Rip off!! Only scammers would do this, anything to make a profit.. But hey, thats what I get for trusting savers..

Not only does this place serve gorgeously presented desserts, but it's delicious as well. I sat at the counter and had a great view of how they prepared the desserts. They literally make everything as it's ordered so it does take some time to get your food. I got the 2 course and one a la carte.

Coffee jelly tiramisu: This one came with the 2 course dessert and had layers. This is where you dig through the milk foam and some kind of mousse to get to the coffee jelly. If you don't, tastes like frothy milk. Once I tried everything together, the coffee flavor was pretty prominent and the cream chilled it out. 

The carib: This one was made beautifully in a wine glass and had a piece of white chocolate on top. Some kind of sauce was poured over it, causing it to melt in the dessert. This was a mix of fruits, sorbet, and creams for a refreshing melon tasting dessert! This was by far my favorite one. 

Forgot what the last one was called but it was a purplish sponge cake that they injected cream into. Make sure you get every layer because we didn't notice that there was a berry compote on the bottom until the end. This cake was pretty good as it was super fluffy and had a hint of what tasted like taro. The compote sent it over the top with it it's sweetness!

Start with the staff, horrible.  They text us when our table was ready (I like that idea), however when we arrived to be seated we had to wait another 15 minutes while our table was getting ready and we were corralled several times to get out of the way by a bunch of scantily dressed host staff (kids).  The atmosphere, loud and annoying.  The food, even worse.  Start with greasy fries and the worst dipping sauces, mayo but not mayo for the Europeans, and catchup but not catchup for the Americans.  Both sauces were terrible and the fries dripped with grease.  Next the onion rings were even filled with more grease and the batter didn't stick to the onions.  You had to eat them with a knife and fork and the sauce was another disappointment.  A good dipping sauce for onion rings is chilled thick ranch dressing, sounds simple but very few places provide a good ranch.  The stuff they served here was so bad I could not eat it.  Next was the shake or what they called a shake.  It was more of a parfait concoction with various flavors but it didn't resemble a shake in the slightest.  When you are craving good old ice-cream forget ordering this crap, it isn't even close.  The only good thing about the shake was the cookie.  Finally the burgr, another huge disappointment.  Rather small but thick and undercooked.  My wife cannot eat red meat so she ordered hers well done and of course it was completely red in the middle.  The staff argued that it was in fact well done, we were already miffed about the shake so we didn't argue, just vowed to write this review and never come to this place again.  When you consider paying an average of $35 for a burger, fry and shake the price is insane and what you get for that price is criminal.  Never felt so ripped off before.

My car is always dirty when they are ""done"". The service is lacking and the guys there are just not great to deal with. Guillermo is great, but that is really about it. He will actually remedy a complaint that you have, all the other guys pretty much give the attitude that they don't care. Time for new help, Cobblestone.

I took my truck here after a little playing in the mud and the very first thing the guy says at the window ""your gunna have to pay for the extra mud package if you want all that off"". WTF? What is the point of a car wash? These guys are so into up-selling and hustling for a few extra bucks that it is embarrassing. Are you serious? A mud package? You're telling me right off the bat that I need to pay extra for you guys to just do a good job? Or they want to sell you on a quick hand wax, which is a guy spraying Meguire's quick detail on your car and rubbing it off; very poorly I might add. 

I know that the job that these guys have is not easy, but damn, it's your job, not mine. These photos are after going to the car wash 2 days in a row and getting the ""$30"" car wash. It is terrible, not to mention that they are scratching the fuck out of my clear coat because there is still obvious dirt, everywhere.  I did this intentionally so that everyone could see how badly they do. But if I were to pay the extra $$ for the ""mud package"", would there really have been a difference? Because I got the hand wax before, and there was still dirt on my car.",6,0,1

It's a hidden gem I like to keep in my back pocket as a cool alternative for informal occasions. The menu may seem a little daunting if you're unfamiliar with the Izakaya experience but I've slowly made my way through the entirety of it, and have not been disappointed. Some staples include the fried pork belly, the spicy short-ribs, apple salmon, monkfish tacos, Chilean sea bass, and the excellent oyster selection. The atmosphere is pretty cool too. Thursdays-Saturdays have a more upbeat vibe, dim lighting, a DJ and a really vibrant crowd, whereas the rest of the week is a little more subdued. A good option for a more informal social event, whether you have a large party or as a couple. The shared-plate, tapas inspired menu is the perfect alternative that gives you the opportunity to try a little bit of everything. They also have an awesome cocktail menu, beer options, sake selection and wine list for all your beverage endeavours. Skip the pub or wing joint and pop in here next time.",0,0,1

My biggest problem with this place is that EIGHT YEARS ago they didn't do their job to screen vendors they allowed to work in their lot.  I pulled in for a car wash, was harassed by the HIGH PRESSURE sales of the windshield repair guy who promised two free car washes if I let him fix my window chip.  HUGE MISTAKE. Search Yelp for ""AJ's Auto Glass"" and read the HORRIBLE reviews and the EIGHT to TEN YEARS of harassment we have endured due to FULL SERVICE AUTO WASH NOT screening their vendors.  DON'T DO BUSINESS with either of these guys, you WILL BE SORRY!

The windshield repair guy told me his receipt was good for ""2 free car washes"".  When I returned to get my free washes, the windshield repair company had been booted and no one seemed to know anything about the promises of free car washes.  SCAM!

I found them through the USAA car buying program so o figured that they were somewhat trust worthy since they are a trusted USAA dealership but I was so wrong! I was surprised at the condition of the office. It's very ragged. The receptionist was very unprofessional and so was the sales man. They have pretty nice looking cars but don't let that fool you because the cars will break down within the first month or so. And DO NOT purchase their warranty either because it's just as bootleg as their whole operation. If you have thousands of dollars to throw away then go right ahead and purchase a car from them but if you're in the market for a good used car steer clear of this GHETTO BOOTLEG RAGGEDY car dealership.

My man and I came on Saturday to watch the EuroCup games and try a few beers while visiting Toronto. Since we weren't planning on eating, we decided to sit at the bar (also for a better view). The bartender took at least five minutes to come see us, and immediately asked what we wanted. When we mentioned it was our first time in, he set menus on the bar and walked off. He came back after we'd had a chance to review and I had a question on the Lemon Tea Beer. I hadn't tried beer with black tea before and the lemon made me think it would taste more like a radler or shandy. I asked him about what the flavors might be similar to, if it would be too sweet, and his dead pan response was ""It's a beer that tastes like beer."" Okkkkay. I can see you're going to be rude here...

I attempted to order something else on the menu, was told it was out, and given a ""similar"" alternate beer recommendation (which was actually nothing in style like the one I tried to order). In the end, I did order the tea beer. It was nice and refreshing, but would have been way more enjoyable without the attitude. We finished watching the game and hadn't seen our bartender in ages. We finally flagged down a gal who was mixing drinks for seated tables to get us our check. I'm not sure if A) our bartender's shift ended and he just didn't tell us, or B) he was too busy being a jackass to continue waiting on his existing customers. Either way, I wouldn't recommend it, nor will be back in the future. I'm sure there are plenty of places in town that serve their beer AND will give you decent service.",5,0,1

I booked the team about 2 weeks before my move and Tim was always readily available to answer my questions. I filled out the inventory sheet for my estimate and was able to make adjustments up until the second he and his team arrived. His prices are very fair compared to the competition as he charges by piece that's moved versus by the hour (Don't be intimidated by this if you are moving an entire house or lots of items, they are reasonable)! When I booked his team, I was given a timeframe to expect them on the day of my move (7-11 per my choice in options offered), but was told I could call the night before for a more narrow estimate. I called the night before and was told they would be arriving right around 7 am. The morning of my move, Tim called me at 6:45am to say he would be arriving at 7:15, talk about promptness! When I booked my move, I was told Tim and another guy would be taking care of my move. When Tim arrived, he had a team of he and 5 additional guys. The team was very friendly, professional and FAST! I had everything ready to go in my garage when they arrived to make the process as easy as possible. They had everything packed into their truck in 10 minutes and were on their way to my new place. When they arrived at my new apartment, there was a truck in the area of where moving trucks can unload and if he had to wait, it's an additional $25 per 15 minutes of waiting to unload. We were able to talk to some maintenance men and have them move their truck so Tim's moving truck could also pull in. This took about 6 minutes to coordinate and he did not charge me an additional wait fee. The team had me direct them as to exactly where I wanted everything and they placed it right where I requested. They unloaded their truck and were gone within 30 minutes of arriving at my apartment. This was a very smooth process and I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking to move. My parents are planning on moving soon and after seeing how efficient this team was, they are considering using them for their entire house. Go with ""A Master Mover"" and you won't be disappointed! 

Update (January 2017)
My fiancé and I moved into our home in January of 2017. After having such a great experience with A Master Mover the first time, we decided to use them for our final move into our home. Their prices are fair and they work quickly. Tim even helped us unload a few large items from our UHaul that we loaded and moved ourselves to save some money. 

My only (minor) complaint is that I don't think they wrap the furniture for protection enough. We wrapped a lot on our own but Tim's team didn't wrap anything. We didn't have any damage this move, but my first time using them I did have a few dings in my coffee table and side tables. Definitely not a reason to go with another (more expensive) mover but that is why we wrapped a lot on our own for this move. I do highly recommend this service to anyone looking for a reasonable mover! Thanks again, A Master Mover!",0,0,0

The last time we visited (about 4 yrs ago) I would have given it 4 stars. First of all, they are no longer Monarch Resorts, they are Diamond Resorts (which they were very vague about this transition). We got there on a Friday around 12pm. They took us to the ""VIP"" check-in. The lady was really, really nice but I get the feeling the employees no longer have a clue what the hell is going on with this new ownership. Our check-in was supposed to be at 1pm so she said since we were early that she would go ahead and get us into a room right away. ""A room with a nice view and a better room than the one that was reserved."" We were like, ""Woooow well thank you, we really are VIP."" Pfff! We go up to the room and the following happened:
 As soon as we stepped out of the elevator, we noticed it was HOT and muggy. And *crickets*. I mean it's good that a place isn't packed but we thought it was odd that it was super quiet...ghost town. We go into the room and the place is a mess!! And I kid you not, looked like it was being used as storage (which I know realize it probably was). So we call right away and they tell us to come down to the front desk. coming to find out, that whole building was empty bc it was going through ""renovations?"" And guess what? The people that has reservations in that building were sent to other rooms...and guess what? Our room was taken by someone else! So we waited for over an hour to get a room. So for our ""troubles"" they give us 3 complimentary breakfasts for the 3 adults (as in, the 2 kids in your party don't get jack squat). So whatever, we go down to breakfast the next day and again we notice it's like ghost town. We go to the cafe on the voucher and it's closed! So we go to the building that has the bar and we go in there and after waiting for him (only guy working there) to get off the phone he says we can order breakfast there. Which I will say, was good. We end up paying $30 for drinks and the 2 extra breakfasts for the kids. Monday morning we have a meeting. This meeting consisted of them trying to convince us to buy directly from Diamond Resorts BUT you must continue to pay your Monarch Resort payment. Yes...2 payments. Well, at least we will use other Diamond Resort places but they def need to work on Cancun. It's such a beautiful place with horrible service! 

Extra star is for the convenience of the rooms (2 rooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen\/dining room, living room, tv in each room, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, pots\/pan, plates, cups, utensils).

I'd initially contacted no less than three of this sources highly recommended commercially licensed plumbers and three handymen.  Those who bothered ti respondr provided outrageous quotations.
 
The job I was seeking services was installation of a basic utility sink in my garage.  The price quotes I'd received from the aforementioned three A-list and highly recommended commercially licensed plumbers and one handyman (two handymen never returned my email or calls, all A-listers) ranged from $705 to $850 for services.  These quotes did not include the sink, faucet and other plumbing essentials.  Belsito quoted and did the job for $342.57.  Their quote contained a few dollars for miscellaneous parts beyond what I'd obtained from Home Depot.  I purchased an all-in-one utility sink package that contained a faucet, P-trap, flex water lines and some other parts plus some copper pipe, elbows and angle stops from Home Depot for about $120.  In the end the job ran me about $465.
 
I dealt with a gentleman named Gene who took my first call scheduling plumber David to come out to my residence at no charge to look over the project and give me an estimate.  I received a formal quotation the very next day, which as I said is exactly what I paid David upon completion of the work.  Gene quickly scheduled the work and David arrived on time and was done in the time estimated in the quotation.
 
Am I living a dream or did I just tell you a story whereby I received quotes from other highly recommended commercially licensed plumbers and one handyman for what surely would have been more than twice what I paid Belsito Plumbing LLC?  I can't say enough about my experience with Belsito, Gene and David.  They were very professional, courteous, timely and most of all fair.  What more could you ask for and exactly what I'd hoped to find.  I highly recommend them and will myself call upon Belsito for all my plumbing needs in the future.",6,1,0

Reasons why:
1. Always crowded
2. RUDEST STAFF EVER
3. equipment is FITHY and they're usually out of wipes to clean it
4. manager's see you not as person, but as a dollar sign. 
5. tried cancelling multiple times after working out but I couldn't because ""the operations manager is the only one who cancel, and he's not available at the moment""
6. took me about 3 weeks but when I actually did cancel (mostly because of the abysmal customer service), the manager got mad at me for cancelling and told me to leave the gym and he would cancel it for me.
7. HE NEVER CANCELED IT FOR ME. I was charged AGAIN the following month and had to go back to the gym to a refund
8. When I went all the way down there THE OPERATIONS MANAGER WAS NOT THERE so I was forced to stay and wait for him to return from his lunch in order to cancel.

I've been to many other LA fitness gyms before and there was never any even close to how bad this one was. I would not recommend this gym to my worst enemy. This is the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. That goes not only goes for gyms, but in all places of business in general.

We ordered one of the spicy thai pastas and the brussel sprout and bacon pizza to share so we could try both one of the pastas and one of the pizzas.   
The pizza came out first - overall I would give it a five out of ten.  The reason being the brussel sprouts on top were not cooked enough, so we were biting into the soft ingredients of the pizza yet had big crunchy brussel sprouts in our mouth.  I assumed the brussel sprouts would be shaved on the pizza not served chopped in big hunks.  Okay, moving on.
The pasta came second.  The menu advertises the pasta as being served ""al dente"".  Rather, we got a bowl of mush. Secondly, who ever made the pasta put so much curry in our dish it was inedible.  We love Indian food, Thai food and Mexican food, so spice is not an issue.  But a balance of spices is key to a good dish.  If I would have had my eyes closed eating the pasta I would never guess there were other ingredients in the bowl, everything tasted like red curry  powder\/paste.  Awful.
We flagged down the waiter and told him the ingredients were off.  He recommended another pasta bowl which we noticed had peas in it.  We told him my husband was allergic to peas, and he said that he would tell the kitchen to leave them out.  So, we agreed to try that pasta dish instead.  You guessed it, it came delivered to our table 15 minutes later loaded with peas.  We waited another 7 minutes to show our waiter what happened.  He said he could not believe it, he even ""told them not to put in peas"".  
The second bowl of pasta was also no where near al dente - moving the spoon to see all the peas determined that pasta was very over-cooked also.
So, there you have it folks.
We were at the restaurant for 1 and 1\/2 hours only to leave with left over pizza in a cardboard box we would need to heat up at home because the ingredients were not fully cooked through at the restaurant.
The restaurant is VERY noisy, screaming kids, the tables are packed together (we could hear the conversation next to us).  If you want to have a private conversation, not the place to go to.
If you want to have a nice, quiet evening together enjoying wine and your meal, not the place to go to.
Oh, and let's not forget, both the men's and the women's restrooms were out of commission.  Something wrong with the sewer or plumbing, so there were signs on both doors indicating they could not be used.

We ordered take out and upon paying realized that they charged us $0.50 for each item that we ordered because it was to-go...it wasn't a huge deal but annoying since they didn't mention that when we ordered. We also thought that maybe it was for the containers, but they packed everything into as few containers as possible. 

Once we got home we opened the containers and were bitterly disappointed. I ordered a side each of rice and beans ($2.95 each) and received maybe a couple spoonfuls of each. My boyfriend ordered Chile Colorado ($10.25) and received less food than a typical kids meal. 

If the food was good, it might be worth the price but it certainly wasn't. We won't be returning.",3,0,1

Rosie is 9 years old and prior to April, she was fairly healthy!  It all started with a broken tooth, I had taken her to a different emergency vet after she woke up with a hugely swollen face! She was prescribed some meds along with amoxicillin and we were told to follow up with our regular vet! 
The next day, after having started the amoxicillin I woke up to her laying in a small pool of blood at her mouth, I took her to our regular vet right away who said Rosie really needed to go to a pet dentist to get a tooth extraction and a root canal to solve the issue.  So here we are 2 days in and I take her to the pet dentist who went over the procedure, cost ($$$$), etc. so I agreed to have the surgery done that day and as scared and nervous as I was for my baby I left her there and waited for the phone call that she was done... I instead got a phone call 45 minutes later and right then all my fears came true... I had to go back and pick her up and take her to VetMed critical care hospital right away!!! What?!? I couldn't even breathe... My baby was suddenly in critical condition, she had been administered the pre-anesthetic and during this time her heart rate was plummeting, she had a heart block in 2 areas, her oxygen was dropping and suddenly her life was hanging by a thread.  We go pick her up and my poor baby is practically lifeless with a huge bandage on her neck! They attempted to take blood from her main vein, but it wouldn't clot so now we know her platelets are non-existent and and they also found she had hardly any red blood cells!! The pet dentist called ahead to VetMed so they were expecting us when we arrived and they welcomed us with open arms. I handed the vet tech my baby and just burst in to tears, not knowing what was going to happen... It was all happening so fast!  I filled out the short form and now we wait... after about 30 minutes, we are called in to a room to await Dr. Hooper and finally get hit with a ton of bricks.  The doctor suspected Rosie had some sort of autoimmune response from the amoxicillin, it basically was making her immune system attack itself so it was killing her platelets and red blood cells!! She explained she has seen this before and she gave a guarded prognosis until she could rule out all other underlying conditions and confirm her suspicious.  With our consent, we left Rosie in their care a prayed for the best.  We got a call that evening from Dr. Hooper that said after all the testing, there is no evidence of any underlying condition that could have caused this so now, our only hope was for a blood transfusion to buy Rosie time for the medications to work on suppressing her immune system and rebuild what had been destroyed.  We were given all the facts and risks associated with the transfusion, but it was our only hope.  That was the longest night of my life, but no news was good news and we made it through the night without a phone call which meant the transfusion went well!  They, Dr. Hooper and the VetMed staff saved Rosie's life... they were amazing, never bothered by my phone calls checking on Rosie, let us come visit her in a private room for as long as we wanted and Dr. Hooper, she was an angel!  She came in to visit and update us on how Rosie was doing, called with updates while I was at work, just amazing! Rosie was there 3 days, but it seemed like an eternity at that point.  It has been 4 months and Rosie is still on daily medication and my regular vet still consults with Dr. Hooper to this day about her continued care and recovery.  We may have to deal with this autoimmune condition for the rest of Rosie's life, but I am just beyond blessed and thankful she is still here with me!  I will never go to another emergency vet, VetMed has won my trust and respect! A million thanks from Rosie and I!",0,0,0

- butter chicken, naan, gulab, ice creams are good. 

Bad:
- Everything else except the food I've listed above.

Service: 
-OMG OMG!!! what the heck is he doing? eEXTREMELY bad service 
the man only came once which was to fill up water..never came after to refill them
-did not take our used plates
-my husband and i stood at the entrance for about 5 min watching him walk back and forth but never welcomed us or gave us a seat.
-food had wrong ""names""- my husband could not eat beef ..the sign said chicken so he took it and the light was dim&red light;\/(was bad for my eyes when I looked at the meat which the red light was shining on) so we could not tell til we got to our seat
 -man yelled at him for wasting food(really it was both mine&his combined so we can stack them) and threw the plate back down on the table
-beef&mutton signs had the same meat
- did not come to check if were okay during our meal
-the only waiter was i guess the owner who didn't see us at the doorway and yelled at us

Food:
- Nasty.
- Mutton was so soft and mushy
- Tandoori had ""meat blood"" very visible is every bite
- Only had 3 typical flavours of icecream& gulab, slices of orange

Washroom:
- Very stinky
- Febreeze air sprays on the sink counter
- No paper to dry hands

Restaurant overall:
- Dirty
- Plates already on the table had pieces of dirt of some kind which was covered with napkins
- Table of 2 was very small

Located on E Carson St, the nightlife mecca of Western PA, and the street with the prettiest and bareliest-dressed boys... I mean girls... perhaps anywhere outside Florida and California. And I think the food is actually really good.

I have heard from a number of people that this place really sucks. I'm not Cambodian so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like over in Phnom Penh, but I have to say that I found the food to be really good. It's a little pricy but then what else is available at 1 in the morning? 

There's a reason why there's such a long line here. There's a couple of good Gyros around here (cough Mike & Tony's cough), but if you don't feel like a Gyro, then why not come and try some of this excellent curry-ish deliciousness. 

The really funny thing about this place is the bathroom. You need a key for it which they will gladly give you - but it's attached to what basically is a lamp post. So you have to drag the lamp-post with you to the bathroom... it's hilarious.

The restaurant is very elegant and offers a great view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountain Show. 

I suggest making reservations and get a window table. Neither of which we did by the way :-( It was a last minute deal and it was on a Monday night, so we thought we would wing it. We didn't have reservations so we decided to wait at the bar and have a drink. 

We ordered 2 glasses of wine, a Shiraz and a Riesling, whoaaaa $46!!! I made no reaction, which my girlfriend liked because the couple next to us that ordered 2 drinks, yeah his eyes almost came out of their sockets...lol. Anyway, we waited almost an hour and the bartender, JR, said we could eat at the bar, which we did. He was very nice and helpful giving us Vegas tips on restaurants and clubs. Also, there was much entertainment between the three bartenders as two of them kept making fun of the ""new guy"". 

Once dinner finally came, it was excellent. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. Also has the asparagus which was great. In the end the total was $260 for food and wine. I would probably go again if I had a little extra $$ to spend. 

Just a tip, it is a little upscale as I said.

I only stopped by Arsenal Cider House this past weekend for the first time. I was just planning on getting a couple growlers for my company's holiday party (which consisted of a 3-hour long bus ride to Cleveland's Fatheads flagship). It started out as an innocent attempt to get some libations I knew everyone would enjoy.

I *definitely* shouldn't have underestimated the power of 8% cider! (Yes, I said 8%. That's like a fine wine.)

Let's just say the growlers never actually made it to the lips of anyone else but me. Let's also just say that I'm a 5 foot 3 Asian girl with the tolerance of a teenager drinking for the first time. Let's also just say, I DRANK THE ENTIRE GROWLER OF CINNAMON CIDER. BY MYSELF. BEFORE I EVEN GOT TO CLEVELAND.

Indeed that was a rough weekend, albeit a delicious one, steeped heavily in the fermented juice of apples. I warn thee, the cider goes down a little too easily and the intoxication sure sneaks up on you!

Growlers here are about $20 a pop, while refills run from $13-17. I left with the cinnamon (8%) and concord grape (8.8%) and both are sickeningly good (literally).

They put the tires on, and when I went to pay they said I needed a new right front CV axel and boot for about $900.  I said no, because my partner used to own 4 auto body and mechanic shops.  Immediately, he noticed there was a noise and thumping in the tires indicating that the tires were out of round or a bad steel belt.  We also took the car to our local mechanic who said the boot needed replacing, but that the whole thing comes with the axel, so for about $300 he replaced the right front CV axel with a brand new part.  Now this is not my daily driver, and it is an older car so I am very careful about how much money I spend on it. After the axel and boot were replaced, my partner said the tires were still making noise, so he took it back to Ted Wiens on a Tuesday.  He rode with the technician who agreed there was a problem, but said he couldnt do anything until tomorrow when the manager was in.  He came back Wednesday, manager still was not in.  Came back Thursday and spoke to manager about problem.  He didnt have car with him so Carrie told him to bring it back Friday.  On Friday, he brought the car in with original paperwork.  Carrie put it on the lift,  and rotated tires after her test drive.  She came back into the service area and told my partner that it is not the tires,  she said it needed a new right front CV axel. (She saw that on the original paperwork).  My partner asked to put that in writing and she asked him to sign it.  Then he told her the axel is brand new, it had just been replaced.  He said it cannot be the axel it was just replaced.  Carrie said it depends on where the work was done.  He said, so what you are telling me is if the axel wasn't replaced here at Ted Weins for $969, you are not going to stand behind your tires.  She said there is nothing wrong with the tires.  My partner says there is no way she could know that because a damaged steel belt would not be visible from a visual inspection.  Needless to say, she would not even look at the tires that are under warranty.  Used to use them for all my company and personal vehicles.  Will never use them again!",1,0,0

We placed a delivery order and about an hour later (which, hey, that happens it's lunch hour and busy) our order for three arrived in a 1\/2 filled shopping size bag.  At first I thought they had forgotten some items, but no, that was the whole order.  We did 1\/2 portions for The Dougie Sandwich, The B Salad, and The Sunni Southwest Salad.  

The B Salad menu price was $8.00, though only a 1\/2 portion you would expect a lot more to an $8.00 salad.  They described the salads as ""rubbery chicken"" with that thin watery-style ranch.  I had The Dougie Sandwich, menu price *only* $8.00 (1\/2 portion).  This turned out to be just a few inches of basic roll with cold bland brisket, though the sweet potato chips were decent enough.  Overall the consensus was this was very disappointing and overpriced.  

Maybe they treat customers better in the cafe vs. delivery orders, or maybe it was a bad day?  I don't know, but this is my honest review of Dougie J's Cafe.  The delivery driver mentioned they had great American style decorations, guess I will never know since I wont be back.

I uploaded a few pictures, you can judge for yourself if these are worth $8.00 before tax, delivery fee, and tip (comes out to about $11.00 each then).  At least it should have tasted good for the price...",3,0,0

The ambience is cozy and exotic. The service is par excellence from the greeting, to servers and the host.

We ordered a sashimi combo, spider roll, cherry blossom roll, volcano roll, medusa roll, and Galbi. Sushi was all the same sauce with thin slices of fish. Nothing special. The fish seems a bit on the warmer side which makes me question the temperature in wish they keep their raw fish. Galbi had a weird odor and taste.

No one over the age of eight goes to McDonald's for the food.  We either go because it's quick (sometimes) or cheap (not anymore) or convenient or because we are craving that childhood food memory.  So Jim and I met there this morning  (score one for convenient) for a quick snack and chat about the week.

While we're waiting for the food I notice a sign that says they have free samples on Monday morning.  I was fascinated by this.  Since when has McDonald's offered samples?  And who hasn't tried their potatoes and needs to know what they taste like?  Who doesn't know the taste of crunchy grease without a reminder?  So, curiosity getting the better of me, I asked for a sample.  I really wanted to see what it was.  That's when I was reminded where, exactly, I was.

I was told that there was no way I could have a sample.  When I inquired why that was I was informed that the person accompanying me had ordered what they were sampling.

Oh.

Though most yelpers know my prolific yelper husband, this woman did not.  In fact, she had no idea who he was in relation to me.  He could have been my husband but he could just as easily been an anal colleague who would rather die than allow me to sample his food, which I assume was the implication in her refusal.

Now, I acknowledge that this is a ridiculous nothing of an issue.  But these days I run into more and more silly little annoyances and I just couldn't let this one pass.  You see, the woman was very satisfied with herself, as if I was trying to ""get over on the man"" (i.e. McDonald's) and she thwarted me.  It's just so stupid.  So, I guess they saved themselves a quarter of a hash brown but they got this nifty review instead.

The restaurant was pleasant and the servers very welcoming and friendly.

We ordered plantain and black bean empanadas to share for an appetizer. These were really delicious, you could really taste the plantains. I could sit on my sofa at home and eat thirty of these things.

For the main course, I ordered the Carnitas which were tasty, though I would have preferred them in Tacos. I know I was taking a little risk ordering differently from usual. The carnitas came with some small, fluffy tortillas and a variety of fixin's - pico de gallo (which was a little sour), a slaw of some sort, guacamole, and a little salad of chopped red onion and cilantro. Overall it was very good, though I'd probably order more in line with my usual preferences next time.

My wife had the Mushroom Mulita which she enjoyed very much, although I'll let her go into that in greater detail when she writes her own review.

We had enjoyed our experience here so much that we were tempted into dessert. Something I really like about Border Grill is they let you get half slices of two of the dessert options for $9 as an alternative to a whole slice of one of them for $8. This lets you try two different things.  We went with the Flourless Chocolate Truffle Cake - absolutely melt-in-your-mouth incredible, and the Pastel Rufina, a sort of cream cheese cake in puff pastry and topped with profiterole-like objects. This came accompanied with an attractively arranged display of fresh berries. The Pastel Rufina, even for a half slice, was enormous and we couldn't finish the thing between the two of us. I'd hate to have to finish off a full sized slice!

He stated there is only 2 TXV valves in the valley and he can go pick it up but will not be able to install until the morning and the cost would be $900. The good thing was at least we still had one unit which was working so part of the house was still a little cooler. The next day A Quality called and said 2 of their technicians had to go to the hospital because of heat exhaustion and they can not install our part until the next day. At 6:30am the following morning a different technicians from the first day shows up does all the inspections again and after about 90 minutes comes back and says the first technician was incorrect in his diagnosis the TXV valve is fine the compressor was broken. This technician like the first went to his truck and after 20 minutes caromed in and says he has great news they have a compressor to fix our AC unit and they can give us a good price. It would be $2,900 and it comes with a 10 year warranty. My wife and I said can we have a breakdown on costs but the technician could not supply but would have the office call us. The technician left and my wife and I said lets get another opinion so we called another AC company the guy was out in 20 minutes he did a complete diagnosis and just to let you know we did not tell him what the first company said. He came back and said the TXV valve is bad and he explained everything to us and that is when w retold him what A Quality said. He stated the first tech was right the second one miss diagnosed  he also said the repairs for a TXV valve would be $325. Allot less. He made a few calls and came back and said there are no TXV valves in the valley and it would take a day or two to get but he said I have another option we can purchase a new coil which will have a better valve then the TXV valve already in the unit and he can do it today and it will be more but still less then $900 and allot less then $2,900, we said go for it.

Well, an hour later, more people had showed up, bringing the group total to 5 and as 11 hit someone finally got a hold of cube smart corporate who could not really help us at all. Luckily Penske ended up having trucks at a different location. So I took my second lift to the next place when I had only intended on doing it once... Waste of money.

I like my apt and the view but the grounds are not so great. The problem is many tenants are slobs and management doesn't seem to care. For example, many irresponsible dog owners allow their dogs to poop and pee wherever and don't clean up. I know mgmt will say they clean up 4 times a day, but believe me this isn't so. Many tenants can't be bothered putting their trash in the receptacles they just throw it over the wall and where it lands...sometimes it's so bad you can't even get near the container to put your trash in it. I recently had a family move to my building with a young dog that can not make it downstairs to do its business. I repeatedly complained to the office and even reported the person when I saw this happening. I was told it was my word against theirs and they denied it. I wish I could post pictures here because I've been taking pics of the conditions as proof. Another problem is cigarette smokers, butts everywhere, in the halls on the sidewalks. One tenant wrote in chalk outside their door imploring people to be more responsible. The response was more butts thrown by their door. I feel management has to have a stronger presence. If people saw them walking around noticing things maybe they wouldn't be so apt to breaking the rules. These are my complaints, some of the other complaints I've heard were the jacuzzi was broken for many months and broken gym equipment. If you're considering moving here I suggest takint a good look at the grounds and walk around and ask  tenants their thoughts. I wish I had.",5,0,0

Like others, I purchased a Living Social ""deal"". The online scheduling was a breeze and I was surprised to find an appointment available the following day. First, the tech did not call to tell me he would not be able to make the scheduled appointment, he emailed. I did not get the email until I checked it when he was late. Second, when he did show up the following day, he sent another email saying he would be early! Upon his arrival I showed him the areas to be cleaned (much less than the 1200 sq, ft. I had supposedly paid for). He proceeded to clean one section in the middle of the kitchen, then told me that to do the rest he would need to acid clean it and it would be an extra $175, thus turning my $24 ""deal"" into $199. The work was done quickly, but he tracked acid, water and dirt over my new flooring that wasn't being cleaned which he did not clean up, rammed the equipment into the baseboards and transitions, chipping or dislodging a couple of them, did not move fridges, stoves, washers, etc. so those areas were not cleaned. I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to clean up the new flooring and stairs which now have a haze (probably from the acid), and sopping water from under the appliances. 

Pro tips- 
1) Call don't email if you're not going to be there, not everyone has email notifications sent to their phones.
2) Clean up after yourself!
3) Stop with the bait and switch, it is dishonest and makes you and Living Social look bad",5,0,0
mLPODy0mzXxGijk2n9Eguw,hpd_megho0wUkdoDnWMHsg,Dcp9djUhDx4ERv8CgZnpDg,5,2017-06-09,"Easily one of my favorite hotels anywhere. Let's start with the building and the rooms: a quick glance should tell you how you're going to feel about it, as the whole modern and minimalist feel with concrete everywhere isn't for everyone. But if you are into that, it's fantastic. The rooms look and feel like you should be paying a lot more a night.

While the style is what drew me for my first stay, the people were the reason I knew I had to come back. Quite literally everyone I interacted with was wonderful. Whether it was the manager, the front desk staff, the bartenders, shuttle drivers, or housekeeping, every single one of them was pleasant, easy to talk to, and made me feel at home very quickly.

Since it's a smaller hotel, staff is pretty minimal, which for me is a perk - you'll recognize everyone after a day or two. Better yet, they'll know you. My first stay was a few weeks ago, and this time around I was immediately recognized at the airport, people remembered my name and conversations we had, the manager introduced himself, etc. Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about the staff and how incredibly welcoming they all are.

The only ""complaint"" I have is that it's a bit far from downtown, just shy of two miles on foot. But if the weather is nice, it's a pleasant walk. They also offer the perk of free bicycle rentals through the city bike share program, so between that and the shuttle it's easy to make your way to the capital. Also on the topic of the shuttle - they do provide complimentary to and from to Epic if that's what you're here for, and on your last day they'll bring your bags and get you from Epic and get you to the airport.

I rented the car for two days they charged me for three day and tried to over charge me again because they said I was suppose to return the car at 7am which the agent at the desk didn't explain. I rented a many of cars and never had this much bs happen. So I was suppose to pay in total for the rental $95.13 and I'm was charged $200. Where they do that at?

I go up there and the workers in customer service are rude and can't give you any answer which is highly unacceptable .

When this place first opened, it had a lot of promise.  The space is nice overall, and the very stale Madison gay scene was in need of some serious reinventing.  Unfortunately, everything that made this place cool has either faded or disappeared completely, leaving behind a rude, overly-pretentious crowd in a club that is desperately trying to give off big city vibes.  It's not working.

Let's start with my biggest problem: it is virtually impossible to get a drink here.  Bartenders are beyond slow, terribly inattentive, and usually downright rude.  I've never seen a bar with so many barbacks, and yet the bar is never appropriately stocked.  At any given time there could be as many as five bartenders or as few as one behind the main bar.  They frequently disappear for long periods of time, leaving crowds of people desperately fighting for space at the overly cramped bar.  Moving some of the chair\/stools out of the way on busy Friday & Saturday nights would help with the space problem, but you'd still be fighting to get the attention of a single bartender.  There is clearly no system in place for working the bar here, as bartenders don't stick to one area, and it's completely possible to stand at the bar for 20 minutes without being noticed.  This is totally unacceptable to me, and it's not because this place is popular.  I've been to many, many clubs across the country on some very busy nights, and have never waited as long as I did at Plan B.  

The second major problem is the people.  While this was created as a gay bar, it is clearly not any longer, having been completely overrun with college-aged women who have no qualms about pushing, shoving, and kicking their way through the crowd on the way to the dance floor.  I've never been pushed in a bar so many times in my life, and it was almost always by straight women.  I get that Madison doesn't have much for dance clubs, but it's unfortunate that the straights need to behave so rudely in a space that was not created for them.  I certainly think straight people should be more than welcome in any gay space, but they need to follow the rules of basic etiquette.   If I wanted to be pushed around in a straight club, I would have gone to one.

Sadly, the owners don't really seem to care.  Although the club has been open now for well over a year now, it still looks largely unfinished in places.  The bathrooms are a mess, and the walls are terribly bare.  There are still major ongoing technical problems (an extremely poor\/spotty sound system, cheap and uninspired dance floor lighting, and music that frequently just drops out mid-song.  DJ's generally spin bland pop music with no idea how to work a crowd.  And did I mention the awful staff, who are far more apt to spend time removing their shirts and checking out their own bodies than actually serving drinks?  Don't bother trying to make suggestions or constructive criticisms on the club's Facebook page, as you'll only wind up being deleted.  Very classy, Plan B.

Bottom line, this place isn't worth the time, effort, money, of frustration that a visit will undoubtedly cause.  I won't be back, and you shouldn't either.",16,2,4

Their chowmein was good, their fried rice was good, but the chicken was terrible. I had chow mein with orange chicken and bourbon chicken. Orange chicken was bad, couldn't even finish it because it was so bad. However, the bourbon chicken (if you decided to try it yourself) is actually probably their only good option because it was delicious. My boyfriend got chow mein and fried rice with beef broccoli and orange chicken. His beef broccoli was more leftover soysauce than actual beef, and when he did find some beef, it was tiny. What the hell? 

The food was not good, I will never come back to this restaurant. I did enjoy the potstickers, but expensive for those so not in a hurry to come back for those. 

Also weird service, the girl serving the food doesn't give enough of the 1st and 2nd options (ex: chickens, not the chowmein or rice). She hardly gave my boyfriend anything and the girl serving drinks, overfilled everyone's drink, maybe they should switch jobs. 

Pick Up Stix if you are reading this my suggestion for better food is to keep your chow mein recipe, keep your bourbon chicken, and the fried rice, but change that orange chicken recipe, that killed it and offer different potstickers. Also, make sure your servers are serving enough food for those options, because we don't want to be just eating soysauce when we're supposed to eat broccoli and beef..

Today was the topper. My husband purchased a suit a couple of weeks ago. Of course it needed to be tailored. It was to be picked up today. So my husband arrives home to show me his new suit. Opens the jacket expecting the trousers to be hanging under it... Nope, no trousers. We tried for an hour to call the men's suit dept. , no one ever picked up. Just rang and rang.  So he goes back to the store, only to be told they don't know where they are. Upset, and obviously used to a higher caliber of service, he asked the clerk why he didn't check that the whole suit was there. The clerk told him he thought he just bought a jacket. It said ""suit"" right on the bill. Anyway, the day was saved by a young associate who tracked down the trousers at the Mentor store. After three trips he finally has his suit. Thank you to the young gentleman, Marlon, who was working today. Avoid the older gentleman, he seems to have lost his passion for customer service.

When it comes to food, taste and quality of ingredients etc I really do care a lot. 

The burgers they served were piece of crap, the bun was bad, the beef patty was dry and the grilled onions didn't taste like one.  They just put dry bun with dry patty and 6 slices of bacon and some grilled stuff and call it a burger. It doesn't get any better no matter how much mayo or mustard you put on it. I have had far better burgers at regular fast food chains like Carl's Jr, Smash burger, Five guys and even Mc Ds. This place is totally not worth the drive from the strip and the money.

Well let's start with the service, now when it comes to Asian restaurants we all know not to expect 5 star, 4 star, or even 3 star service. So with that in mind this place completely blowed. Maybe it was bad luck, or maybe we just came on a bad day, but the service was by far some of the worst I have experienced recently.

First and foremost they kept bringing out random orders that weren't ours, and despite this lack of competence on their part, the waiter for some reason started to get frustrated with us.....(well f*!K him).

Moreover, the lady that was behind the counter (the owner maybe) gave us this piercing dirty look because we were frustrated that the orders were coming out wrong. It was as if she was on her heavy period and I took her last box of tampons and hid them.

Second, the correct orders took forever and day to come out. By the time we had received our orders, two tables were already done eating. We only ordered three entries, but it seemed like the cook had to go to the farm to slaughter the cow and bring it back to the restaurant.

As for the food............it was average. Definitely not a hot spot for Pho here in Vegas. I've eaten Pho since I've been an embryo in my mommy's uterus, so this place is a no go for me. The free water sucks too, you can definitely taste the ""tap"" in the tap water.

First impression is French Provincial!!! Velvet chairs, Glamorous Chandelier, many hutches of early american design with antique place wear.  They have 3 different pastel colored rooms for up to 10 seating in each off to the side of the main room, a room for private parties 12 or more you can close off to make it more personal and an open area with solid marble tables and Velvet seats and Benches for comfortable seating.

Sure, Braddock is definitely not the most happening place, but this brewery seems to be the center of town and was packed to the gills when I was there. It's no surprise; the beers are delicious. Their White Sky is an extremely unique brew, one I could easily drink all day. It's a Chai Wheat Ale, and while it's spicy it's also very subtle. It's a complicated brew that is very smooth, and every sniff will leave you with a different impression. I didn't get a growler but wish I had! Their saison is also decent, being true to form with a crisp spiciness in every sip.

 She took a huge chunk from the back of my hair which was weird and later hairdressers have said is totally dreadful. But worse my hair was in poor condition (something I was later told by a pro) and should not have been dyed. The hairdresser did not do any consultation or tell me honestly that my hair should not have been dyed due to the condition.

This has to be one of the most underrated shows on the strip! (I couldn't believe there were empty seats in the house when I went). I chalk it up to people simply not knowing who Jason Hanson is. First of all, he's not onstage first and an entertainer...he's a former CIA agent. So what you get first in this Vegas show, are reality based techniques that can save your life AND you get entertained in the process. 

For the price, it is a killer deal. I see one reviewer complaining about pay $37...oh my gosh, most of the ticket prices for the other Vegas shows are triple or quadruple this price. I mean think about it. What is the average price of a show on the strip? (I'll tell you cause I checked them all to see which ones I was going to see). The CRAPPY seats are $90-$100, and the best seats approach $200 a piece. On top of that, unlike the Spy Escape and Evasion show, you can't take your kids too the highly publicized shows because of all the nudity. Most folks don't take their kids to Vegas, but still...a LOT of people do and even if you don't...maybe you'd just enjoy a show that was void of half-naked people that will show you stuff that can save your life.

As for the value. The girl sitting next to me went up as a volunteer to escape from being tied up. When she got back I leaned over and asked her ""Hey, was that real up there?"" and she told me ""Absolutely!"" She didn't think she was going to get out of being tied up like she was, but said she followed his simple instructions and escaped the ropes like she had been doing it her whole life. I thought that was pretty cool. Now, after being there and coming home, I can say from experience that the best thing about this event was they, Jason and one assistant, show you EVERYTHING. It's not like they show you tricks onstage and then you have to buy the secrets afterwards. What you see on stage is simple enough to remember and repeat on your own. I mean I came home and showed my friends, people from church, my kids friends, it's like we have our own little spy training sessions going on here. 

In short, this is not one of the highly produced shows with magic and special effects, you won't to see compelling illusions and super sexy people doing things that make you want to slam shots and put the ""do not disturb"" sign on your door when you get back to your room...BUT...if you want to have your breath taken away, and meet a real former CIA officer, see some very cool techniques that can save your life if anyone ever captures you and means to hurt you, this show is a great choice.

There's a couple items I could've done with out including the Moroccan chicken skewers and the salmon. The salmon was very plain for all the ""dressings"" and the chicken was dry and plain even with the tzatziki. That's the only negatives I have. We had everything from the beef filet crostini to the Gorgonzola salad, sliders, ceviche, onion soup, bacon wrapped dates, and three diff flatbreads- Thai chicken, steak and mushroom, and chorizo and sausage. All were completely up to par. Nice atmosphere and good food to compliment. The portions are all tapas but VERY filling and satisfying. Will definitely return. Beignets were decent but the smores flatbread was amazing not overly rich but absolutely got the point across. We had two young kids With us and even though my kids do extremely well I think it's more suitable for adults for sure, it's just more intimidate yet casual. Good for some wine and tapas with friends or a nice date night. If u do happen have children with you, they definitely cater just fine and don't make you feel out of place.",0,0,0

I just love everything about this place aesthetically. The chairs, the color, the feel something about this place just works in a French industrial kind of way. 

Service: 5\/5
I've eaten in the bar as well as the restaurant. While I personally prefer they bar because I like the chat with Angel, the dining room is a solid choice. I've been here on about 5 occasions and have never heard a complaint. 

Cocktails: 5\/5 (can I give 7 stars?)
I cannot over emphasize how amazing the cocktails are with Angel. I love classic cocktails and was very spoiled living in NYC with a mixologist roommate that worked in secret members only bars. At Spago there was one fantastic bartender, but he got promoted to oversee cocktails for all Puck restaurants. I catch him when I can. Herbs & Rye is spotty with their drink making. I had an amazing drink once (made by a guy with tattoos) and horrible one same visit (made by the owner, and I sent it back). Angel is consistent and by far my new favorite. Old-fashioned, sazerac, sidecar, mojitos... All fantastic creations. Plus he's down the street, and it doesn't cost me $15-$20 a drink. Score!

Food: 4\/5
With the cocktails so far above what I would expect in Vegas (especially off the strip in a non craft cocktail setting), the food is disappointing.  It's very good but nowhere near great. My biggest gripe by far was the lobster bisque without lobster, but even the rue was above average at best. With the exception on the rainbow trout, I felt like the seafood from all of the other dishes (shrimp and clams) weren't the freshest. I could go through a list of things I had there, but honestly, there's nothing memorable.",0,0,0

We stayed there for 1 hour at least at the bar and many people left and they didn't get us. I saw a table for two leave and they gave it to two people who just walked in. I questioned them about it - and each hostess gave me a different story to excuse it. In the end we left and ate at the Shangri La.

I really love what they did with the place. So much better than before! If you haven't been yet, you should check it out. 

Already they were off to a great start with the major improvement in the atmosphere. Then we ordered and WOW, their menu blew me away too. So many interesting dishes and drinks to choose from. I can't wait to go back and try more! Everything we ordered was great but a few favorites were the Pork Belly Yakitori and the Charred Edamame. That Pork Belly just melts in your mouth. You must try that! I also loved the fact that they had so many choices for Sake. I ordered the House Infused Apple Sake and it was so good that I ordered another. Also worth mentioning... the Caterpillar Roll and Philadelphia Roll but I prefer to recommend things that are unique because you can order these items at any sushi bar. I'll try more of their menu and update this review after I have a few more visits under my belt but for now I was way impressed. 
They even have this cool app called Rockbot that you can download to choose what music they play. I had fun with that. 

As an extra bonus, there was a familiar face there. Much to my pleasant surprise I was able to locate a chef that I had lost track of named Koong. She's a chick whose sushi game is on point! Now I already know this restaurant knows what's up since they hired her to work here. No wonder I loved my food!

I had an ear infection in May.

Went to a handy walk-in clinic in Leslieville (not this one).

Got drops, ear infection went away, but my right ear got clogged behind my ear drum. Don't get excited, it's not that Instagram -worthy wax plug that comes out by irrigating it. It's a fetid pool of fluid BEHIND the drum that is making me deaf.

Went back the same clinic. Got more drops cuz fungus.

Ear still clogged. Went to my family doctor where I should have gone in the first place but no, too lazy, I'm so fucking lazy I deserve to be deaf. It's now early June. Family doctor referred me to a ENT specialist because my ear is lLITERALLY WHISTLING when I blow my nose. I'd laugh if it was your ear but it's mine.

I wait a week, finally the referral appointment comes through...it's for JULY 30. UGH Thanks, Obama, I can't wait this long. Some lady in my spin class tell me of this clinic I am writing about  that will fix ears right on the spot. It happened to her son apparently. The doctor drained his ear and he walked away 10 minutes later like nothing happened.
I go to the clinic, the doctor is nice enough but he says my eardrum is either punctured or clogged. He referred me to their very own ENT specialist who will be in their office June 15, two weeks before my hospital appointment. I am somewhat disappointed but grateful nonetheless.

June 15 rolls around and I run to the appointment. 

I am always excited to meet doctors because I have so many questions and I'm so bodily obsessed.

This fucking doctor looked like he came out of a coffin. He was wearing a shiny wrinkly suit from your Chinese gramma's tickle trunk and he reeked of moth balls. He spoke pigeon English and could not understand my story. He looked in my ear and saw NOTHING ...of course he didn't, he was 200 years old and blind and not even a doctor but some crazy mofo extra from a 1950s horror movie. He filled a syringe of water and that's when I should have bolted but I was paralyzed with fear. He blasted my ear til water went through my nose and then he looked inside and said: ""oh you have a hole there and probably 20 percent hearing loss. But you don't tell me how it happened so I can't help you.""  I TOLD YOU I GOT AN EAR INFECTION IN MAY. Oh my God. He gave me a prescription of ear drops which I threw away. That was a week ago and my ear and nose are still leaking water. At least I still have my hospital appointment to look forward to.

The upside of being deaf is that I sleep like an angel with y good ear buried in the pillow. White noise is the answer.",0,18,0

For the AYCE, basically you can get everything on the menu with small exceptions which the waiter will tell you. Other than that, you can choose what peaks your interest.

Both sandwiches were piled high with beef and all the fixins. The bread was fresher than anything I've EVER had in any restaurant.,  The sandwiches were nothing short of amazing! The beef was so tender and flavorful. The cheese sauce was very good, as were the portobella mushrooms and caramelized onions. The coleslaw was crisp, not swimming in dressing...just like I like it. The potato salad was fresh and delicious also.

I'm so glad we stopped in and will be back often!! I have been disappointed by every other cheesesteak in Cleveland, but have finally found a winner! Thanks for a perfect lunch.",0,0,0

My friends and I were staying at an AirBnB close to this location and figured it would be an easy place to access for some lunch. We wanted to get some sandwiches from the deli.

We walked in asked if we could get some sandwiches made. First, they said they did not have any rolls and pulled normal pieces of bread off the shelves. Next, they took about 15 minutes on EACH SANDWICH. We ordered four sandwiches, nothing crazy, just some simple sandwiches.

Further, there were flies crawling around the deli area. I had to ask them for brand new bread because flies crawled over mine while they were shredding the meat.

We also initially asked if we could pay at the deli instead of waiting in the normal store line. One of the ladies working there rudely said ""no you cannot!"" We asked the lady who was actually making our sandwiches and she let us pay there, but wasn't too happy about it.

The very last thing about all of this was that we paid about $5.70 per sandwich for regular bread, non Boars Head meat, and an overall unsanitary sandwich.",2,1,2

Then came the reflexology: He washed my feet in a bucket and proceeded with a foot massage you might receive during a pedicure procedure.
I said to him, this is not a reflexology, but he did not understand. I asked his colleague who was working on somebody else, but just got a smirk back, like take it or leave it lady, this is what you get. I was just wishing that it will be over soon.....
I paid the required amount for the services, and left a 13% tip, which was evidently not enough, as I got a dirty look from my ""therapist"", who did not performed what I paid for.
I do not think he is licensed, or even trained in a basic massage,  he must be somebody who just fills in, when nobody else is available.

A resourceful staff member took us To a booth with cushioning which as torn on one side and wet from being freshly wiped.

Food served cold. Sambar that's key to a South Indian Dosa meal must always be served hot but was served cold. Their excuse for cold sambar was that they're just preparing it because of the rush. Shouldn't that mean the sambar should be hot?!?  And their servings for sambar are too small. They skimp on the chutneys. 

We'd ordered a Kara dosa which they got wrong. Not authentic at all. 

Hot coffee served cold. And when we asked for it to be brought back and served hot we got a lame excuse that the milk was just poured fresh, what fresh from the fridge?!?  When they did take the coffee back, it never was served again. And we still got billed for it. We asked for water several times.  Not served!!!  They finally brought out a jug of water as we were putting on our jackets to leave.  

This is the 3rd time in as many months that I've made the mistake of coming here. But no more.  

This place sadly does not have its act together and gets a big fat zero in both the food and service department. One of the staff even have the excuse that cold food is a 'kitchen problem'. Hello, is management listening.

The bartender called to us as we were finding a table that we would need to order from her and then I had to search up my own menu.... and just as I was starting to rethink my decision she started to SHINE. She was fun, funny, cute, perky and just had a great personality. She apologized frequently that she felt she was neglecting us (she wasn't) and that she was trying to split her time between the bar and us. She did mention in passing that the wait staff and the chef no-showed (reading the other reviews this seems to be a trend) but that the executive chef was manning the kitchen and she was getting her cardio in! The bf ordered the Country Breakfast Sliders and I had the Classic Breakfast. My only disappointment with the food was the hashbrowns. I'm from Idaho, I expect real, fresh, crispy, grated potatoes on my plate. Instead I got a patty of frozen potato- but truly the best damn patty of hasbrowns I have ever had! They were delicious! I was doing some serious eyeballing of the sliders and cursing my gluten intolerance - fresh roll, country gravy, chicken fried steak...YUMMMY. I will say that the portions are small. It was perfect for me, but the bf would have been hungry if he hadn't hauled down a few pieces of left over pizza while we were packing.

It looked like Sherry had some fantastic yelp reviews, so I was eager to try out her services and leave her a rave review as well. However, my experience with her customer service has been nothing but pure frustration.

As others have mentioned - Sherry's voicemail box is constantly full, which makes it impossible to leave a message about scheduling an appointment. I called three times over three days and could not get a hold of her. She is also unresponsive to text messages, even though she offered texting as a way of getting a hold of her. Finally, I sent a message through the Pure Elements website, hoping to get a response within 48 hours as is promised online. Still nothing.

After spending numerous days unsuccessfully scheduling an appointment, I contacted the Groupon customer service representatives to see if they could help me get in contact with Sherry. They said they'd left my phone number with her and that I should expect to be contacted by the business within three business days to schedule an appointment. It has already been three business days. Needless to say, I will be asking Groupon for a refund.

When we arrived last night, we went upstairs and sat at the bar as we normally do. We first ordered drinks, and all I could taste in my cocktail was soda water- no grapefruit whatsoever. I had ordered the wings and pickle plate, and the wings were completely undercooked. They were cool on the inside, slightly pink, and slimy, and I could absolutely not eat them. Even worse, my friend ordered the half chicken, brisket and sides and when he took a bite of the chicken I could immediately tell by his facial expression that something wasn't right. I would consider my friend a risk taker when it comes to eating some questionable leftovers and I have never seen him eat something he hasn't liked- and he immediately stated the chicken tasted and smelled rotten and guzzled down his beer and an entire glass of water in attempts to mute the taste. When he had me smell it, it smelled what I imagined would be similar to the stinky chicken alligator bait used in the show Swamp People. When the spoiled chicken was brought to the bartenders attention, he took a long, deep whiff (closed his eyes and all), made a face, and stated ""I don't like smoked meats so I wouldn't even know what it is supposed to smell like. I won't even eat, like, half the stuff we have here"". He asked what we wanted him to do, and we suggested that perhaps he could take it off the bill. The bartender was completely unapologetic and unprofessional. At that point, I felt so awkward by his reaction I didn't even mention that my chicken wings were undercooked.

Because I am a biz owner and I know that these social media scores can have a pretty dire effect... or a great one. But after taking some time to ensure that what I suspected was true, I had to get this out.

The offices and staff are very nice. Skilled and professional. But that isn't the issue. The issue is that this dentist [Helms was the only one I ever dealt with] generates funds by providing services that aren't necessary. Now look- I'm not concerned with the other reviews here- not even the obviously fake ones. This is only MY story. And I have waited literally years to write it to ensure that ""sour grapes"" weren't a part of it.

When I started with them I had been without a dentist for some time. While my teeth have always been healthy [like three cavities my entire life], I brush, duh... and like everyone shoulda flossed more. So after x-rays and ""measuring of pockets"", to see what my gums were doing- Dr. Helms told me that I had some serious issues with gum disease and that I needed a deep cleaning\/scaling. I was mortified. But hey, you gotta do what the doctor says, right?

Submitted and paid. Was told that since my 'gum disease' was a serious issue that I would have to come in for exams and cleaning every 4 months instead of every 6. Insurance covers it 2x\/year... I had to pay for the last one outta pocket. That was EACH YEAR because I was there 2 and a half before I figured it out... It all came together on my last appointment.

Cathy was my hygienist and she was wonderful. I actually looked forward to seeing her! [looking forward to a dental appt?.... whaaa?] What I didn't look forward to was the constant worry about my ""pockets""... Every appointment was a nail-biter as Cathy measured them. But with time and care- those pockets got shallower and less worrisome. 

Last appointment. [thanks for sticking with me, here] Cathy is gone. No explanations. My new hygienist measures my pockets... don't like what I'm hearing... Helms comes in and tells me that it's time for scaling AGAIN. And that this time the insurance won't cover any of it this time. Feeling like a dirty scumbag leper... I ask how that's possible because the 'gum disease' hadn't been an issue for years now. Complete ""recession"". She said NO, gum disease NEVER goes away.  

Cya - I'm off for a second opinion, Dr. Scrivello... 

So long story ending as quickly as possible... The next dentist I saw said that I had no signs of  gum disease. I switched to another dentist - not important why - no sign of gum disease. I related my experiences and was told that yes, you can beat gum disease. You always have to stay on top of your oral hygiene [like anyone] but it's done all the time. I was also told that it is VERY rare that anyone should need more than one scaling, if it's done correctly.

So listen. If you show up and ""Helms"" is still on the shingle... Back away slowly... but if you like to watch TV while you receive painful dental procedures that are as unnecessary as they are expensive- I encourage you to visit.. I believe they even let you run the remote control...",13,1,1

They will not tell me over the phone if they have a particular medication in stock or not. I deal with chronic excruciating pain.  I've had 4 spinal surgeries. I'm not able to sit or stand more then 10 to 20 minutes. I can't drive at all and it's very difficult to find someone that has the time to drive from location to location every month to see if my medication is in stock (their inventory is an entirely different issue I'll address that at a later date). I understand they are protecting their pharmacists and staff because of the type of medication it is. However, all they need to do is ask me for my information, maybe some identity questions liked birthday Address etc... look me up in the computer to see if I'm a customer that normally gets that medication around that time of the month. Maybe even log the call. I seriously doubt a legitimate customer that gave their information, and has a prescription that needs to be filled that day, is going to come back and rob them. Sometimes it just takes a little bit of common sense.

What's more, the pharmacy staff were very abrupt when explaining this new policy to me. Empathy and understanding go a long way. 

Needless to say I now fill my prescriptions elsewhere. Thank you CVS and Walmart for having the common sense to screen customers, asking the right questions before giving information about the availability of scheduled medication. Doing this in a way that protects the staff, yet provides the very minimal service that a customer expects from their pharmacy.

AS FOR THE WALGREENS STORE IT DESERVES A NEGATIVE 5 STARS!!!   You need a coupon out of the circular or the monthly pamphlet to get the advertised sale price on the shelf and sometimes you don't. It's confusing to know what are on sale, need a coupon for circular, or need a coupon from the monthly pamphlet. They will tell you either. And what's really frustrating is they don't know. Hey Walgreens manager, coach your team, teach them how to focus on one customer at a time even under pressure. Teach them to address the line in between customers and apologize for the wait. Customers have a difficult time being angry after someone has acknowledged there what has inconvenienced them and apologize for it. Each week give your employees a circular to review for 20 minutes on their downtime. This will cutback on you're long lines (being held up by customers and employees searching for the sale coupon in the circular and\/or the monthly pamphlet) neither one knowing where it's located.  In addition, it'll save an employee frustration which impacts morale. And of course the obvious, your customers will be happier!",1,1,0

If you want a sub go to Subway. I love their subs! They're tasty and pretty cheap. This Subway only has 2 workers in at all times and they get very busy at times. These so-called pizzas are labor intensive and not worth the effort. You're better off buying a frozen pizza and cooking it your self. They take a flatbread and cut it in half, then toast it. They pull it out and put on tasteless pizza sauce, then top it with a miniscule amount of pepperoni and cheese. Then they toss it back in the toaster. Depending on how long they leave it in there, it will either be almost burnt or very soggy. By the time my 4 flattizzas were ready there was a line of customers behing me.

1. Failure to clean up spilled oil causing large oil spots on a clean driveway
2. Oily grease and finger prints all over the vehicle inside and out wherever they touched it including the inside window where they put the reminder sticker. Not just finger prints, oily finger prints with old oil on them. From the bumper, to the hood to the side windows from below and up top.

FURTHERMORE, back in Feb\/Mar of 2015 +\/- the same location changed my oil and didn't properly tighten the oil filter and when I drove 300 miles to LA the next day pulling my motorcycle trailer there was oil streaming out of the bottom and it had gotten all over my undercarriage and sprayed back all over my trailer and motorcycle. The local Jiffy Lube in Long Beach replaced the filter and the manager there called the Vegas location with a heads up.  The Vegas team's failure here could have very easily destroyed my truck engine.

Frankly I'm appalled at these problems and the lack of QC and proper training at this store.  We've been good and loyal customers coming to this location for 12 years with our Suburbans, Mini-van, Hummer and now the RAM 1500.  I don't know how much we've spent but at over $100 a pop I'm sure it's a few thousand dollars.

Where's the pride in your store?
Where's the manager?
Where's the QC?
Where's the training?
Where's the workmanship?
Where's the corporate oversight?
Where's the leadership?
Where's someplace else to service our cars?

If this were my business I'd want to know and now you do.
Thank you for your time and sadly I think you've pretty much lost our business for good and anyone we talk too.",0,2,0

Not only were my girlfriend and I lied too about how many people were actually in the bar (NONE) but unlimited drinks were for ladies only. Not men.

We both love Scooby Do's. They treat my little butt-faced dog like a prince and are receptive to correcting anything about the cut that I perceive as being weird. Like that funny poofy pompadour. Mohawk it out, yo. Done. In like five seconds my little man was looking fabulous and bad ass. Not something easily accomplished with a prancing pup that literally chases butterflies through tall grasses. (He ended up looking like a little lamb as the cut grew out too. So adorable.)

The shampoo they use here is also amazing. Noodles usually smells like tacos (a combination of beef stank and corn chips) but after getting back from the Do's, he smelled like Christmas morning! Sugar and spice and everything nice instead of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. He's got some gender identity issues to deal with. 

The pricing is also cheaper than some of the big name conglomerates out there. I'm talking to you Petsmart! I've taken my other pup to Smelly Dog before, but unless I need dog sitting play time after the cut, I'll go with Scooby's. They genuinely seem to like my little Noodle monster.",3,2,0
DeN8gFaGlNKZ02DfKEz8Eg,6nrw7Cf7AYET_PzOsymP0g,ajoqEHnCZTD8-8GqGLq9-Q,1,2017-11-20,"It had been 12 years since I stayed at the Palms...it was place to be back when it first opened and the Maloof family owned it. The rooms were nice, clean, and the casino was fun back then. Not so much anymore. I checked in for a 4 night stay since it was where the conference I was at. I booked a king room in what was supposed to be their newly renovated ivory tower. The minute we arrived, we were surrounded by construction noise and mess. Over half the casino was walled off and most of the restaurants were not opened during the construction, except for their food court. Their front desk staff was very limited, so the wait to check in was long, and they were fairly clueless. I had booked at bottle and room package through the palms.com website and when I asked about the details of the promotion, all I got from the front desk staff was ""I don't know what that is. Call the reservation line."" Most other Vegas hotels pride themselves on customer service and would have had the promotion prepared or at least resolved the question for me instead of telling me to call the reservation line.

Then it got worse. I arrived in the room to drop my luggage off and to change before a group of us when out for dinner. I noticed there was no soap in my room and the TV didn't work....it turned on to the welcome screen but all channels were a black screen. I called the reservation line to inquire about my bottle package and to ask housekeeping bring up the basic toiletries and maybe send someone up to look at the TV. I excepted all of these to be in my room when i returned from dinner on the strip but none of it was there. By this time i was tired so I turned in for the night. But before i fell asleep i noticed one of the 4 pillows smelled bad so i just threw it on the floor. 

At 550 AM the next morning, I was awoken by the sounds of concrete being jackhammered and dumped into a construction container....WTF! And this was with me on the 16th floor, I can't imagine the noise guests heard on the lower floors. 
Then things got even worse...I was walking barefoot to the bathroom and stepped on something sharp. Turned out to be sunflower seed shells in the carpet. On closer inspection of the room, I found jellybeans by the window, and oatmeal flakes on the flor near the desk. Clearly, I had spent the night in a room that was not cleaned prior to my arrival...probably why I also had a stinky pillow. At this time, I called guest services again and told them they need to have my room cleaned immediately, and I was still waiting for my bottle. I left for my conference at 7AM and returned later to find things had been taken care of and I had a promised bottle of JD in my room.

Little did I know, that apparently would be the last time housekeeping would clean my room for the rest of the week. I would see them outside down the hall from my room when i stopped by at noon everyday during my lunch break but I would always come back to my room later that day with the bed unmade and dirty towels still on the floor. 

Also, what the is the daily $33.69 resort fee for? The ""high speed"" internet was never faster than 1MB\/s...impossible to watch netflix on. When we tried to go to the Palms Place Fitness Center to work out, we were told it would be another fee. And it wasn't until the 3rd day did we discover the ""free shuttle"" to the strip...it would have been nice if we were told about it on check in since we were paying for it. Frankly, with the construction mess and noise that was going on, it would have been a nice PR gesture if they had waived the resort fees.

Frankly, the entire resort is a mess. The rooms were dirty, walls were paper thin. The casino was limited because of the construction, only 1 craps table, literally right next to the front door. Everything was smokey including the hallways outside of the rooms, gaming staff weren't friendly and sometimes rude, and the drink service was slow to almost non-existent. 

The new owners at Stations have their work cut out for them. In addition to renovating the infrastructure, they need to do some serious retraining of their staff. Vegas is about customer service...you need to make the customer feel like they are being taken care of and having fun while they are being parted with their hard earned dollars.

At this point, I would NOT recommend staying at the Palms, especially during construction. I will NOT be returning to this property at anytime in the near future.",5,0,0

Well save your money...As I was at the desk there were two people in front of me were changing rooms due to issues with their rooms. I brought this to the GM and also  wrote a letter. No one contacted me back. OK then..just so you don't experience the same.....heres my review....maintenance  and housekeeping issues are present all over the hotel.  Some of the employees seem to be rude to guests Ir$$e in the club floor Sh@#la at the front Desk both should be working at a post office. The hotel seems to be a fragment of the Hilton. Dead on M-T-W so if I was spending modest I would get a better value elsewhere. The hotel overall is VERY dirty, public areas such as elevators haven't been clean in years. I had to change rooms myself because the tub  was black and mildewed in the bathroom, drain stopped up.  The only good thing is the beds they are comfortable...but make sure you have your Resort Key when entering the club room...despite signing in.... I was interrogated by the gal this morning. She made it clear not to move till she validates the list.  Moving on to reservations department - had to change a folio name on our company block ...had to remind agent three times spelling of the name of Jason  ....finally I asked her to write the name down..needless to say ad to get a manager to complete transaction. I would stay away until another chain buys it and changes out the entitled employees. Not all employees, there are some really nice ones but some of the upper services you experience entitlement. Like take it or leave it ...I have worked here for years...you on the other hand guest are only here for a short while...so don't mess with me....No hospitality message here I will in the future if we are at a convention book the Spring Hill suites across the street. (Marriott) if you need to be in the convention.. I almost forgot a few more items They did not deliver laundry it went to the wrong room. At $15 per shirt you would think you would not have to chase down your laundry-- arrived 9 pm. oh yeah union rates at convention ridiculous - to unload two boxes from a truck it was $700.00 - they would not let us unload our own we are a heavy truck equipment dealer?? SAVE YOUR COMPANIES MONEY - Good service and a clean hotel would negate rates but if you are going to have unclean room and poor service - there are plenty of other choices out there.

UPDATE - HOTEL IS IN RECEIVERSHIP \/ 50% OF THE STAFF ARE THERE and are not happy about the cuts - they are trying to sell  so you may not get the best service ...SAVE YOUR money...........................

Federal Express sends you a package you will pay $5-50 just because they received it there

He replied ""we don't suppose to give free pass if you're not planning to enroll here with us"" and I said ""well, then if is a great deal for you and the company you don't have to do it"" and he didn't give me the free gym pass. 
I was member long time ago right at that location and I left because is so corporate. That guy once again showed me they only care for getting people to sign up and get your money. He put pressure on me even before I got to sit. It would be nice to hear ""Hi there! I'm glad you're back here again. Thanks for considering us to be your gym regardless if you decide to stay in this location. All LA fitness will
Meet your needs so please feel free to ask question  and try our gym once again"" But no, he was far from that. He's an idiot. He and all LA fitness representatives are the same. They care less if you get healthy or not as long you keep paying their monthly fee. I was considering to return in a different location but he made me change my mind.

        First, this place offers exceptional customer service. The bartender, Stephen, was on top of it all night and made sure I never sat with an empty beer! The servers Mikeal, Misty, Kelsey, and Jen were phenomenal!!! They were all sweet, helpful, and personable, which is something that is too often missed with businesses these days. The GM and owner were not only present, but also serving the clients and both came to talk to me individually and ensured everything was going well!

         Second, the food and the beer they had on tap were excellent!! I requested recommendations from the employees and each item was great; (philly fries, fish and chips, Stone IPA and Raj)!!!! 

          I will be traveling to downtown Phoenix frequently for business and they have earned a loyal customer each and every time I return!

I LOVE Changing Hands. LOVE. I mean I LOVE books so it would be hard not to but just like another reviewer pointed out, not only can you buy books, you can trade them and\/or get store credit. With just as many used as new it's not uncommon to leave with several, having spent about the same as you would on one brand new title from a bigger bookstore. 
The staff is helpful and polite and they clearly love to read as well. I've grabbed a few books from the employee picks wall and I haven't been disappointed.

The menu is reduced from the other locations, which makes sense.  I ordered chicken fingers and fries.  The coating barely stuck to the chicken, my plum sauce has been dipped over onto my fries and the fries were boring.

Did not choose them myself as they had an exclusive contract with the venue. When we did our tasting, I was already concerned with the presentation and quality of food. We were paying approximately $100 per plate and I did not think it met that level of food quality. I emailed her to express my concern. Her reply is that she ""never had a bride complain about her work."" Big red flag! Since I was stuck with her, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. 

On the big day, as I suspected, the food was a disappointment. We had a cocktail hour and paid extra to have more selected appetizers passed. My guests told me later that items were still frozen in the middle. Plus, they did not bother to save us a plate of the items so when I asked where our plate was, they had to scramble to put something together and we only got 1 out of 6 items. Pretty sad since we were paying for this event that they did not honor the bridal party. 

The entree choices were prime rib and chicken. Once again, it was one step above cafeteria quality. The prime rib was overcooked and dry. Chicken dish was average. 

I budgeted a good portion so the food would be right. I feel food is a big part of a great party and it was my priority to have it well done. Even despite my concerns to her beforehand, she still blew it. So embarrassing to have frozen items served to close friends and family. You would think she took extra care to make it right after speaking to her.

After the event, when I brought up the issues she basically said that they only budget $25\/ plate. The rest is decorations and other stuff. Ridiculous that you do not inform us about that when planning the event. She did refund some money but it still does not repair the damage to my special day and the lasting memories of this problem. Warning to any bride if you are using them! Clearly there are other dissatisfied customers so this lady cannot even be trusted with her word. As a business that is a cardinal sin.

Last time I was there I had a salmon salad, which was good though in all honesty the salmon was the star of the dish.  I asked the server to please ask the chef how the salmon was cooked so such perfection.  I honestly did not expect for any type of response.  Lo and behold, a gentleman came out and explained the procedure utilized to get that sear and texture without overcooking or under-cooking the salmon.

Re: Another reviewer's issue with ""soggy fried calamari""
It is tempura calamari, which is different from other ways to fry the calamari.  I have never had any issues with sogginess unless I leave it to sit for too long.  Hmm...  Clearly, they prefer Zinc Bistro.  Honestly, I haven't been to Zinc Bistro so I cannot draw a comparison at this time between the two.

The floors definitely could have used a good mop though. The floor was oddly sticky in the area I was sitting. However, there was just something off with the flavor of my burrito; thus, I just couldn't bring myself to finish my burrito. There's a first time for everything, and this place is closer to me; however, it's just not completely worth it for me. The quality of the fish just didn't taste right, which I think could have been an account of the rice being a little too over cooked. I also got a fortune cookie with my meal, but it was already partially opened. There's other sushi burrito places in town, but this is definitely a last choice for me.

Combo comes with a delicious homemade brownie (and i am a picky brownie fanatic) and it meets my satisfaction. There mac n chees side is just as good as there chilli side i would say. There meats on there sandwiches are very fresh and the seasoning and flavor is unique and A+ and what really makes your purchase worth the money. I guess the only very small gripe is you wind up spending around 20 bucks for a combo if you order delivery after you calculate in the delivery charge and tip.

I had never used a moving company and chose champion movers because they had good reviews on Yelp however, I will never use this company again. 

Upon a 30min. late arrival time from my movers, they were extremely slow and took 2 and 1\/2 hours to move one mattress and box spring set, a desk, a mirror, and about 7 small, light boxes. On the bright side, nothing was broken due to a long thorough packing process. After everything was loaded onto the truck, we were told by the movers that our stuff would be in San Diego in two days. Unfortunately, our stuff did not arrive until the Sunday after (4 days prior to time we were told). When our movers arrived, an hour late, they had lost their elevator reservation, making them take much longer than necessary. 

Due to our concern of packed medications and other urgently needed stuff we were expecting to have based on the original moving time, we tried to expedite the moving process by talking to the manager. Lauren was super nice and understood our concern, but had no control over how we could get our stuff sooner. We were not offered a reimbursement for the extra expenses we needed to spend for essentials that were packed in the move. We were also put on hold countless times when trying to determine where our stuff was or when we were going to receive it all. We thought it was convenient when they gave us direct lines to our movers when they were in route, but when they realized they had quoted us a wrong date, we were ignored every time. 

Please consider all these complications before you hire champion movers and prepare for long packing time, expect about a week or more in advance during heavy moving months, make sure you do not pack medications or other important stuff needed in between moves, and make elevator reservations about an hour after the given ETA.

I thought my life would never be the same.

The best thing about Dr. Harter is that she also specializes in INTERNAL medicine and gets to the crux of your issues - not just adding on one medication and tests after the next. I am so happy to say that after some time I only had intermittent migraines, and fee l like I got my life back! That does wonders for someone's mental state in general. I currently am no longer on anti-preventatives, and only have the occasional migraine that I can treat with a small amount of medicine that usually will knock it out. I know so many people who just keep adding on medicine and it never gets better - just escalates over time requiring more and more medicine. That was me until I found Dr. Harter. The best part about it now is that I also can reflect back on my day and know exactly what the trigger was because she has educated me to this.

I have stayed at the resort two times. Both stays were for one night only while passing through the area on our way home.  

I keep it short and to the point.  The resort is in the middle of nowhere so if your looking for action probably not a good spot.  So on my second stay here we had the Valets park our car.  Went for a swim, ate, went to bed.   When we got up super early the next morning to leave the valet came over and said he had some ""bad news"".  Our car had been broken into.  I'm like are you ""f$&&\/ing"" kidding me?  We are in the middle of nowhere and the car is parked in front of the hotel!""  

Well the car was not only parked in front of the hotel it also happened to be parked in the only spot where there are no cameras.  Hmmm.  Seems fishy.  The manager and general manager felt that this was really our problem to deal with and offered little assistance.  I set up getting a new window installed, we had to argue to get the hotel to allow the valets to drive us to the window replacement shop.  The hotel did comp our stay and buy us a meal, but even that was all nickel and dime considering we wouldn't even need to eat the crappy food if the valets hadn't broken into our car.  

After all this we lost approximately $2,500 in damages.  The Hilton hotel chain blew off any notion that they would pay for any loss even though we paid for the valets to keep our car safe.  We used to stay exclusively at Hilton hotels for work and vacation. We have now switched to a different  hotel chain.  Hilton should seriously have a look at the quality of people they are hiring and the upper leadership of the company which is obviously not doing something right.",1,0,0

Service is friendly enough, but was quickly overwhelmed once the restaurant started to fill up. People joined our table and were not served, orders were forgotten, delivered to the wrong table, and so forth. But they were good about cancelling stuff and not billing us (see ""friendly"" above).

The food itself was completely boring. My ""crispy mackerel in a pita with house aioli"" was not crispy, had not a hint of garlic taste, and the pita was just folded over roughly. It's supposed to be a sandwich, just wrap it around and stick a toothpick in it, if nothing else. Also for $10, I expect more than two small pieces of fish, a few onions and tomatoes, and a small handful of frisee.

I won't go into what everyone else had, except to say that nobody felt they got their money's worth, and nobody had any compliments about the food. Some people left hungry because they didn't want to order more.

If there was one thing of value, it was the pot of tea. For $3.50, I got a big pot, enough to pour myself about five or six cups of green tea.

A bike is a highly efficient human powered piece of engineering marvel that will give you a decade of enjoyment if not more. It will not let you down, will give back whatever you put into it, and will not go out of fashion. A toy is something that will keep you amused for a single afternoon, and doomed to be abandoned and to rust on a city bike lock post within a year. A bike will cost you anywhere between $500 and $10,000. The sweet spot is somewhere in the $800-1000 range. A toy will cost you maybe $250-ish. For a toy, go to your Wal-Mart.

You want a bike. Ok, we on the same page?

Now I would say Duke's the best place in Toronto to get it. I visited close to 10 reputable stores in Toronto before deciding to buy my bike here. If this is your first why-so-serious bike, for whatever purpose, just march into this place, and try not to look nervous. The people here can sense fear... just kidding. They are all actually super nice, but you have to know who to talk to and who to avoid entirely. I will tell you...

If you are a woman, then you MUST MUST buy your bike at this store. Anywhere else is run by a bunch of dudes that will bore you to death with specs and technical blah blah no one gives a damn. But don't just to talk anyone when you go to this store. Clearly they are all bike addicts, but the girls here can give you the best advice specific for women,  If you are interested in mountain biking and off-road riding, ask for Lisa. She is super sweet, and super knowledgeable. She will ask you the right questions, but more importantly will shut up and listen to exactly what you want and what you need. If you want a bike for commuting or road riding, then ask for Gisele. Also a super sweet girl that will hook you up with exactly the right road machine.

If you are a guy, pretty much everyone here is good to talk to depending on your need. Just first ask them what type of riding they do mostly, and if it is similar to your own then you are on the right track. BUT really try to avoid Michael, the store manager. I have nothing against him personally, but don't care for his attitude. His customer service falls quite short also, in contrast to everyone else here. Actually if it was writing this review after only talking to him, I would be giving a 1-star rating to the store.

Now you might ask, is Duke's the cheapest place to get a bike in Toronto? I am not sure... it has a reputation for being on the expensive side. But two pieces of advice for you 1) if it comes down to a lower sale price you find somewhere else, they will surely beat it anyway and 2) forget about haggling to save $25-$75, and instead think about building a long-term relationship to take care of this amazing machine you are about to buy. Duke's offers excellent service and deals with warranties in a customer-always-right attitude, that much I know... that fact alone has saved me hundreds of dollars so far which might not have if I had tried to get the bargain at another store, or worse, I would have lost thousands of dollars if I had bought the on-line sale which doesn't come with the local store service benefit.

So there you have it. Have a good ride!",3,2,3

Micah reawakened my passion and appreciation for art. She made me want to buy a $5000 piece of art!! now that's pretty darn cool.

A few weeks ago I brought in some terribly ugly plaid cushions I inherited from my grandfather, but first, some background information: Growing up, my family and I were always sitting in his family room watching many episodes of Sesame Street sprawled out on the burnt orange cushions. Even though they were uglier than sin, they were still a part of him and the wonderful memories we shared together. He passed away last January and I was the only cousin who offered to take the orange and poop brown plaid cushions. 

When I brought them into the store, I told them about my grandpa passing away and how much the cushions meant to me. I wanted to keep the cushions in the same shape, but I picked out some new cowhide fabric to cover them with. He was a farmer, so I felt it was appropriate. When they gave me the estimate, it was too expensive for me to afford with the extra big buttons and the extra large tubing around the edges. I wanted to keep the cushions the same shape, but all the extra labor costs were simply too much so instead I just went with a basic stitching without the buttons. 

When I came back to pick them up a month later, the seamstresses used the left over fabric to do the buttons and tubing free of charge! The woman at the front who helped me said she told the ladies who did the sewing my story about my grandpa and that they wanted to do the extra labor for free, as a gift. I cried my eyes out and hugged the woman who assisted me. I've received many compliments on the quality work they did and I truly feel every stitch was done with love and expertise. 

This store is incredibly kind and truly cares about their customers. They have made the memory of my grandfather even more special. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!",4,0,4

Went online and booked a flight to Fresno, got the confirmation email the next day and realized that the ticket was wrong. As a rule, all tickets are fully refundable within 24 hours of booking to accommodate mistakes or problems. So I found their phone number and called customer support, was on hold for 45min, no one answered! This was at 9:30am in the morning. Had to work, so tried them again at lunch hour this time hold the line for 50min, no answer! Starting to get worried, called them again at 5pm after work, on hold for 30min, no answer. Throughout the day at work, I tried 10+ times to use their chat program and every single time, I got ""no representative is available at this time"".  Also sent them an email, I didn't get a response to the email until 5 days later. 

The following day, I continue to try the chat and the phone. Finally around 5pm, I held the line for 1 hour and 9 minutes, a representative finally answers my call. I explained my situation and told her how EXTREMELY DIFFICULT it was to get a hold of anyone. I asked for a refund only to be told that the 24 hour period has passed and they will not be issuing a refund and the change fee was twice the price of the flight. I had to purchase another ticket in order to get to Fresno. 1st flight was completely wasted. 

I did take the 2nd flight, they charge a fee for every piece of check-in luggage as well as any carry-ons, you are only allowed 1 free small bag (equivalent of a laptop bag)!

We walk into the restaurant with no greeting so we seat ourselves. We waited ten minutes before someone noticed us... should've taken this as a warning. 

We kept it simple with salad, cheese bread and calzones, good to go... Not quite too difficult. Fifteen minutes later and we still haven't received our salad. The server, Whitney, walks by, stops, looks at my boyfriend with a confused look on her face, then looks down at her order tab then scurries off. About five minutes later she comes back to let us know that the computer ""ate"" our order and she needs to retake it. And this should've been our second clue. 

Yet another fifteen minutes later we FINALLY received our salad. Fifteen minutes for a caesar salad? It's not that complicated. The cheese bread comes out a few minutes later. By this point we had already been there an hour and we still hadn't gotten our main course. The families who arrived when we put in our order for a second time had already eaten and paid their check. Finally the damn calzones arrive. For this long wait I expected them to be amazing. Wrong! Worst calzone I have ever had. The outside was burnt. This inside was barely warm. I had about five bites just because we waited so damn long for this calzone and I was starving! The last bite I could hardly keep down.

So the server comes back with the bill. She didn't take off a penny! No free dessert, NOTHING! I admit we should've said something about getting at least the $4.00 side salad off but I was afraid of what I might say to this girl. I just wanted to get the hell out of there because we were now running late for the rest of the evening's plans. I honestly have never not tipped a server in my life but I happily did so that evening. Absolutely nothing!

Just ask her what's so special and what's the difference between the products she buys and she'll let you know. I was skeptical in coming at first because there aren't many pictures and reviews and I haven't really seen any pictures with fake nails, which I always do.

She always made sure I liked the shape and if ever there's any uneven nails that you spot don't be scared to let her know she is so patient and polite.

The towel rack in the bathroom was nearly hanging off the wall and slanted. The tile around the bath tube on the wall was also peeling from water damage. Also, the shower would pulsate warm to HOT. Let's just say the quality of the room was TERRIBLE and GHETTO. 
Speaking of the casino, our first night the backage boy left our hotel room wide open!! And who knows how long that door stayed open. The bar by the front of the doors had the rudest bartenders. 
Betting at the casino was also terrible. The dealers were absolutely rude,especially this lady named Yeishi. She not only singled me out while playing at the black jack table but straight up said ""You dont know how to play"". 
Overall, the Fremont sucked. We are definitely staying at the California or any other lovely casion with workers who dont harass their guest.",7,4,0

The set up and environment was modern and welcoming. You order on an iPad, which had no description of what was in their ""special rolls"" so we had to judge by the small pictures that were provided. After ordering, they have servers confirm the order before sending it to the kitchen.

The food came at a reasonable pace, however everything that came to our table did NOT look like what was on the iPad.  Not only did they not look appetizing, they also tasted DISGUSTING.  I have never consumed a nastier seaweed salad. How do you go wrong with seaweed salad??? We also ordered a Philadelphia roll (which has cream cheese in it), and the cream cheese tasted like it had gone bad. We told the server to take it away, then she felt she had the audacity to yell at us telling us not to waste food and if we don't like it, we should not order it. We told her the cheese in the roll tasted funky, she continues to argue with us saying ""that's how cream cheese tastes."" First of all, really??? Second of all, I think we all know how cream cheese tastes! And it certainly does not taste funky like that! Third of all, how are we supposed to know if we like the rolls or not without ordering it first?? During this time, our teapot lid was opened, indicating that we needed refill on the hot water. Of course she did not refill it, neither did any of the other inattentive servers. 
We decided to order some more to see if there was at least one item on the menu we would like. We wait for the server to come to confirm our order. Another server comes, and starts to yell at us in Mandarin saying ""you guys are ordering too much."" And she walks off without confirming our order. By this time, I was PISSED OFF. I have never experienced such horrible customer service, and this was the worst sushi I've ever eaten. 
Of course I complained to the manager and l he did was apologize 10,000 times in his accent that was very hard to understand. He then proceeds to give me vouchers for the next stay which I declined since I will never return. By this time, our teapot was still not refilled (after waiting 30+ minutes), so I told the manager to go refill it for our table and stormed out while the rest of my party stayed to dine. 

Many people come here because of the AYCE crab legs. All I can say is, do not order the crab legs. 

I am a guilty foodie and it takes a lot for me to call food disgusting but the food at this restaurant was almost inedible. This is a restaurant I will never return to, and will never recommend to anybody unless they want horrible service and funky tasting food.",5,1,0

It started when I sat down the chairs and booths have virtually no padding and very uncomfortable if you want to relax for a nice meal with friends or family. 

I ordered the 3 meat omelette with biscuits.

Portion size was great for the price, however the potatoes were bland, there was one tiny slice of cheese on top of the omelette but what's worse is that it seemed like it was all pre cooked, the 3 meats were diced, dry and separate from the egg...

But the biscuits... the biggest fail of them all, I've been around to a ton of breakfast joints in this country, I love biscuits! For a place with biscuits in the title I am vastly disappointed.  You should be embarrassed.  These tiny, dry, bland, excuses for biscuits are a joke.

I cannot believe the Hilton would allow such a lousy show to be put forward there.  With so many good shows in Vegas, do not waste your time or money on this one.

There was a small, discrete sign at the entrance that said this show as a ""preview""  - that too is a disappointment.  At no point during the purchase of my tickets online, or when picking them up at will-call was this disclosed.  I don't think it mattered anyway, I can't picture this show getting any better as a ""full scale"" production.

The only positive parts of this show was the extremely talented dancers, great choreography and great costumes.  Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the lame, amateurish performance by the two main magicians.  There is absolutely no storyline, and absolutely no ""steampunk"" theme in the show itself.

Its the cutiest-patootiest coffee joint in the area. And now that I've been adulting and coffee-ying in Atlanta, Austin, and PGH, I can confidently say it remains my favorite.

I have fond memories of job searching in the back room, noshing on scones and sipping on a latte. Then, I had a quick stint at WYEP, hosting the Block Party, so I'd work on my music lists there, too.

So many justified wasted hours there. I wouldn't change it for the world. 

It was always clean. The staff was always elite slash borderline friendly - but only if you asked questions, as is to be expected for any barista.

My memory may be fuzzy, but if its serving me correctly, the owners live upstairs and do the majority of the cooking and baking and trot it downstairs for sale. I could be way off. Someone please verify for me! 

Regardless, I had a love affair with their soups, too.

This review, however, will focus on events from the past 2 weeks.

My husband and I have been trying to get our stolen passports renewed. Last week, after waiting for an hour, I was told that the birth certificate I've had for 31 years was not acceptable for renewing a stolen passport. Steve, who is the supply clerk and also in charge of passports, told us that all our other paperwork was in order, but that I would need to get a new birth certificate. I went online, expedited the birth certificate from my state of birth, and received it in the mail this past week.

My husband and I went back to the post office yesterday (a Monday) to try again, and found out that, despite the fact that the website says 9am, the Tenaya post office will only start processing passport applications after 10am. We waited about an hour and a half, and finally got brought into the area where they do passports. Steve was our clerk again, and he kept nit-picking every little detail on our forms, even though he was the one who looked at them last week and said they were okay aside from my birth certificate. He was literally going over our signatures and photos with a MAGNIFYING GLASS. He even made my husband write his signature several times to get close enough to the one on his driver's license. And the special passport photos I had taken at Walgreens were apparently unacceptable (good ol' Steve said my head was too small in them), so we pointed out that last week they had been fine. So he tried to play the nice guy, saying, ""well, we're not supposed to do this here, but I'll retake your photo and make sure it fits the specifications..."" Meanwhile they had a camera and white background all ready for passport photos, so he was clearly lying about that.

The whole time he was scrutinizing our paperwork, he kept stopping to try and make small talk and give us his wonderful, worldly advice, rather than doing his job. As we were leaving his office to go out front and pay, he gloated to us that he'd killed enough time before his lunch break that he wouldn't have to take any more passport applicants until 1pm. He gleefully told the poor people who had been waiting in line behind us that they'd have to come back an hour later. Because, you know, it's not like people have jobs and have to take time off work to do things like this or anything.",13,2,2

I'm quite a fan of this place. The owners Brad and Johnny are really friendly guys that are extremely passionate about pizza, which shows in their delicious NY style thin crust. I challenge people to name or find superior NY style pies anywhere in Cleveland. I've had the buffalo pie and well as the margarita. Both have high quality sauces, cheeses, and toppings. My favorite part is probably the crust- reminds me of what Papa Gino's may have tasted like when they were still just one restaurant.

The draught beer selection is displayed on trendy LCD screens, featuring a rotating selection of unique local microbrews. Pizza 216's interior is laden with black, silver, and gray colors that are in perfect harmony, adding to the already sweet, hip vibe. The tall mouth of the rotating brick oven is exposed to the first half of the restaurant and bar, which I thought was cool. As recent as this year, they added a much needed patio area where more deliciousness can be served.",0,0,0

So I walked away from the couch yesterday and had a change of heart today - I spent 30 minutes calling the store today to order it over the phone, but either the automated phone service is broken and kept hanging up on me, or someone would pick up and hang up on me right away.

For weekly Reviews like Cleveland Bites on Facebook!

Friday night is date night! Not much of an Italian restaurant fan because after working in one as a teenager I feel most food I get there I can cook at home. When I go out I'm looking for food that is difficult for me to recreate myself. That being said I was intrigued after @Eatdrinkcle recommended this place to me while looking for a good spot to head to Chagrin Falls for reasons that will soon become apparent! ;) We came at 7:30 on a Friday night with no reservation and were seated immediately. They also offer a free valet service despite the parking lot being rather slow, but parking ourselves we did notice how full it was at this early time.
The atmosphere had a modern vibe that still felt classy and not too industrial. Still a lot of wood and fabric was replaced by steel and concrete. Very contemporary! The mood was exciting most of it stemming from the open kitchen concept which is becoming a huge fad and I'm a fan. We were seated right beside the work area and while not overly loud it provided a certain electricity to the ambiance. They do offer an area apart from the main dining area of you prefer a more intimate seating.
Now on to the menu! I was really in love with the menu; how it was broken down, how it was laid out, the options being various and not overwhelming. Very clean concise and inventive options. They offer a full bar and boast an enormous wine list for any price range, but non alcoholic options are limited severely. 
We settled on giving this place the full gambit. Two appetizers were ordered the 'Big A$$ Meatball' (large meatball, whipped ricotta, and provolone, in Italian sauce) and the 'Fried Olives' (Green olives, stuffed with goat cheese and fried). We were started with some focaccia bread which was decent and a nice beginning to the experience, but the apps arrived fast and they were both fantastic dishes. The olives were great. The saltiness of the olives with the smooth creaminess of the cheese paired well and frying them didn't make it a heavy dish. The meatball really stole the show especially for my wife (she had never had ricotta before?!?!). It was large and well made and seasoned, but paired with the creamy ricotta and thick tomato sauce took the dish to a new level. Put us in the right mood for everything else.
For entrees we spit a 'Wood Fire Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza' and 'Semolina and Mushroom Gnocchi' also getting a side of 'Truffled Tots'. The tots were fine. They were good and tasty and the garlic aioli to dip them in made them better. The pizza was hot and delicious! They imported the pizza oven and bring over the flour and other ingredients directly from Italy for the most authentic neapolitan recipe they can. I really enjoyed it but I need to make sure anyone is prepared when ordering this. Not typical pizza. My wife picked up a slice and all the toppings and cheese came spilling off of it. I folded mine and still the limp center drooped heavy. It either a two hand or fork and knife dish to be honest. They are on point with the execution, but a lot of people might not get what they expect. Best for last! Oh my god the pasta was amazing. The gnocchi wasn't too dense or potato-y, but held up against the thick gravy like sauce wonderfully. The oxtail and big chunks of mushroom were also so incredibly well done. Pasta is star here and I approve this message!
We unfortunately had to exempt ourselves from dessert for reasons that will become apparent soon, but are eager to return to check that box as well!
As a final shoutout I want to say how extremely wonderful our waitress was. Knowledgable and enthusiastic about the product she was selling. I was very happy and despite a bustling Friday night crowd felt very well taken care of. Flour gets a high recommendation from me.
Meal for 2 with water, two appetizers, two entrees, and a side dish was $78.

I'm one in a long line of ""crazy"" & ""bipolar"" ex girlfriends that he is smear campaigning. I believed him about all his crazy exes when we first started dating but after so long you start to understand the problem is him & not the women he has dated. After speaking with many of his exes I've learned my story is not the only one of horrific abuse at Eric's hand. Sure, he seems nice but he feeds on the energy of other people, and will pick fights and use your weaknesses to get a reaction from you. His type feed off this kind of energy & love being in control. Once you are trapped in a relationship with him his true colors will reveal themselves & the kind, loving, charismatic guy who swept you off your feet will be replaced with a person who likes to start fights, yell, scream, call you names & blame you for everything.  He can't communicate - and when you bring up your concerns & feelings about the things he says & does he will lie, use word salad, crazy making - also known as gas lighting - and projection to keep you so confused you start to question yourself and think you are crazy. Know that you are not crazy and find a therapist to help you work through the ashes when he is done with you - or you are done with him and move out and on with your life.

The reasons for my low rating:

1.K Von said that she guarantees her work and that it will last at least 2 weeks. 4 days after my gel manicure, it started to lift & peel. This has NEVER happened when I got gel I asked her to redo it and she would only do it on the days she was free. She refused to do it a week after it happened. That doesn't seem like "" I always guarantee my work"" to me. 

2. She was very unprofessional in my opinion. She kept on talking about how little she makes in this business, how expensive it costs. I think she says that so I will tip her more. She also cussed several times in my presence and talked too much about her personal life.

3. The ""salon"" is a small room in a salon and she has a limited selection of nail colors. 

Overall, number 2 and 3 wouldnt really bother me that much. The main concern is that my nails only lasted 4 days.

It is probably the best, consistent burger you can find in town.  Fries are shoe string and pretty good,  beware, a small order of fries is plenty.  They have a lot of different sauces, ( I will admit, most taste like some sort of mayo based sauce with some spices, but hey, its still not bad).

I tried to make an online service appointment via their website. No appointments available. I called their 888 number for service on their website, the number does not get you to service. They have a voice recording to call their direct number for service, no one answered that number and you are directed back to their 888 number. I wrote an email to get service, female appointment taker tells me May 24th. Today's date is March 31st. That's nearly two months! I asked to speak to a supervisor and he said I was wrong, the nearest appointment date is April 24th. I didn't make the date up, their employee gave it to me. I told the supervisor, who's name is Eric Curtis, how he thinks that a 24 day wait for warranty work is acceptable. His response is ""that's what it is"" and then went off on a tangent about it takes that amount of time to get a doctors appointment. I don't need a new liver, I need to have an oil leak checked out on my vehicle that's under warranty. People need their vehicles, a 24 day wait for a service appointment is not acceptable. If a customer needs to wait nearly a month to get service, that tells me you do not have the staff to take care of business. Elevate your standards, ""that's how it is"" is not an acceptable answer and telling me there are four other dealers I could go to, tells me you don't care.

When I called the first time I had some questions.  I mean you don't just walk into a colon hydrotherapy place and have your undigested colon plaque blown out your butt  without asking some questions first.  The girl who answered the phone had a tone in her voice like the questions I was asking were so painfully stupid that it was all she could do to remain civil.  I suppose I must've irritated her by starting out the converstion with ""I have some questions, do you have a few minutes to answer them?""   Yes, I know... Dreadfully rude of me.   As I was having my questions scrutinized by said Detox For Life employee, my next client (I'm an esthetician) walked in.  I said to the girl on the phone "" I'm gonna have to call you back.""  To that she replied ""click...""
Yeah, so that was great. (end scene).  But no...  I went back for more.
After I was done with my client I called back.  She must've had caller ID 'cuz she let it go to voicemail.  I'm way more stubborn that that.  I called back.  She answers in the sweetest voice, I mean staight out of a Disney Princess voice over.  I ask if she is the gal I just talked to a few minutes before (knowing full well it was the same voice),  she said wasn't sure (probably because of the millions of people phoning in to grab the precious few remaining appointments to also have their colons hydrotherapized since the last time I had called twenty minutes prior).  Maybe as a self preservation she blocked out our conversation because of all of my idiotic questions, or maybe she's a liar.  Who knows.    And sadly, after all of this I still tried to make an appointment with them.  The deal breaker was that they take your credit card information to ""secure"" your appointment.  When I questioned the policy she condecendingly gave me this big long speil about 24hour cancellation poilcy blah blah blah...  Yeah, I know all about it.  I've been booking clients for over 22 years now.  AND I GUARENTEE I WILL NEVER TAKE A CREDIT CARD NUMBER PRIOR TO THE APPOINTMENT!  Just my philosophy.   Anywho, so I let her know that with the risk of identity theft (and a distinct feeling that she might LOVE to have my credit card number) I wasn't willing to make an appointment and would be taking my business elsewhere.  She (as you may have guessed) didn't care.  But it is truly her loss because she and her coworkers do not get to behold the beauty and majesty that is my butt hole.  Too bad so sad bye bye.",23,41,7

There are 2 tiny shrimps on top, with a few tiny piece of chicken, tofu and half an egg. The broth is NOT spicy at all... and it tasted pretty bland.

We walk in...I meander over to a rack of women's shirts that are apparently 'on sale'. I find one that looks particulary average. I check the price tag. On sale for 450 bucks. As I'm checking the tag, the shirt starts to rip at the seam even though I'm only gently twisting the tag. Also...notice...""Made in China"" on the back. Quality clothing MY ASS. 

There's nothing special going on here. If you were to take these clothes and hide them with other 'regular' clothes in a shitty thrift store like Savers, 99% of people wouldn't know which clothes are from actually from Barneys. Conversely...you could take a shirt from Savers...put it in Barneys with a 300 dollar price tag...and some douche bag who drives a Ferrari will pounce on it because he thinks it's trendy.

Because I still think about the chocolate from SoMA on a somewhat weekly basis. This is not so much a chocolate shop as it is a chocolate experience, providing a view into all that goes on behind the scenes.

This was my very first exposure to the magical delight that comes with the combination of salt and dark chocolate, so for that I am forever grateful. I can still recall the taste of that wonderful bite of chocolate today.

A few years later while starting off my morning at 49th Parallel (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/49th-parallel-coffee-vancouver#hrid:0s2ahXq4CiQP6WZpyiSAwg) in Vancouver I was fortunate enough to find a chocolate bar collaboration between that amazing coffee shop and SoMA.

Going from the airport to the hotel was fine, other than having to wait 35 minutes (they said it would be no more than 15 min) for the shuttle to fill up with enough passengers to leave. On the return trip, I called and scheduled pick up with 24 hours notice as requested. They scheduled an 8pm pickup and said there was a 10 min window on either side. We went to the meeting place at 7:45. At 8:15, I called and they contacted the driver, who said it would be 8 minutes. 20 minutes later at 8:35pm, the shuttle still had not shown up so we called again and they said they would contact the driver to see how long he would be. 50 minutes is a long time to waste while catching an airplane so we ended up taking a cab to the airport as he never showed up. They said they would refund our money but now I see on some other reviews that that may be an issue too, so we will see.",0,0,0

Like seriously, just bait someone into saying veg food is stupid, then show them my photo. They'll feel stupid because this is amazing. 

Some dishes here try to vaguely imitate meat. My sesame ""chicken"" was surprisingly made with lightly fried mushrooms as opposed to some soy substitute. I also sampled some grilled tofu with a rich, spicy peanut sauce that I'd love to have over some brown rice and vegetables sometime. 

My only complaint is I think they could survive toning it down a bit on the salt. It's definitely overboard and I would have enjoyed my meal just as much had it contained less. I subtract no stars, as I was practically licking my plate!

The interior was really nice with decently sized tables and cool decor - like a US Flag made out of egg cartons (with eggs as the stars)!

The food portions were big - and they even have gluten-free toast, french toast and waffles! Wow! It's hard enough finding gluten-free food in a restaurant, let alone actual bread items!

I ordered the eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and two pieces of toast. The eggs were supposedly only two eggs, but looked more like four - it was a lot of eggs (in a good way!) The hashbrowns were crispy, eggs were fluffy and not overcooked, and bacon thick, crunchy, and not too fatty. The toast was actually really good, considering a lot of gluten-free bread can be pretty mediocre to awful.

My bus, the #9 ran downtown and was pretty frequent. There were a lot of shady people around Public Square and Euclid, but eh, I could live with it. The #22 was hell, even though I rode it only for about 10 minutes. CPS kids made that 10 minutes feel like an hour.

Now, I thought I would try taking it to work. I guess while I was gone someone took a huge axe to the system, because buses run incredibly infrequent. The #9 doesn't go downtown anymore, except for a small amount of rush hour trips (Which I don't understand, because that bus was always crowded to\/from downtown). Using RTA is much more of a hassle than it used to be.

I've been to a couple of different P.F Chang's around the valley and I always have a pretty good time. This time...not so good. 

Our reservation was for 8:00p and I'm not going to lie, I am notorious for being late. By some birthday miracle, I made it to the place about two minutes after 8. I know, late is late, but when my boyfriend made the reservation they told him that ours would be given away if we were 10-15 minutes late...a little confusing, but whatever. We got our table just fine. Food and drinks were good as well. 

Our waitress was nice, but she seemed aloof - which is not something I would hold against someone. What I did have a problem with is her whisking my food away that was barely touched. We were sitting in a U-shaped booth and I was turned to face the group to talk. I wasn't watching over my food(I didn't think I had to) and I had a couple of drinks, so I was definitely very into whatever I was talking about. I could understand that maybe she didn't want to interrupt me...personally, I would have preferred her doing that instead of just taking the food away without checking. My other friends weren't talking, so she could have asked them about it and they would have asked me. We spent $200 that night. That's a fortune to me and to leave with no leftovers when there was plenty....well, I consider THAT a dinner time atrocity. I know I should have said something then, but everyone was leaving so I didn't. I really should have because it's been bothering me! 9\/10 times, I always eat my leftovers the next day. Wasting food is a huge pet peeve of mine...and in this situation it severely irks me because it was food that I was going to eat. Maybe a good solution would be to re-train that server and make sure all of the servers are on the same page.

The gyoza was actually pretty good. I wish we could have gotten 2 orders and be done with it. I had the ginger pork, I pretty much had about 8 thinly sliced bite size pork hidden within some onions and ginger. My husband had a really small salmon. The side dishes were boiled potato, okra, squash and something else - I am not sure what it is. 

Underwhelmed and still a bit hungry, we ordered the volcano. I'm a little disappointed as it wasn't what I am used to. The only fish I found was the fish on the very top, that's it.

We booked a private van to pick us up from SFO a few evenings ago. They were TWO HOURS late picking us up! We had 4 adults and 4 children under the age of 9. I received email confirmation that they had our flight information and would be there to pick us up when we landed at 9:30pm. As directed, I called them when we got to baggage claim. They told me to call them back when we had our bags and were ready to go. 10 minutes later I called them back with bags in hand as we walked out to the curb. The dispatcher told me to walk down to courtyard 4 and that our van would be there in 45 mins to an hour and that I'd receive a call when when the van was at SFO. I was livid. They had our flight information. The flight arrived on time. I asked that I be credited my fee and we would take a taxi home. The dispatcher rudely told me that he was not authorized to give credits and that my card had already been charged. I asked him to tell me exactly where the driver was and if he had actually left Marin yet. He assured me that he was on his way. 45 mins and no van later I called again. I was told the van was only 10 minutes out. At 10:30 I called again and was told to wait just 10 more minutes. Every time I called I was told 10 more minutes. The van finally showed up at 11:30pm. 

The driver admitted that he was in Santa Rosa when he got the call to head to SFO. The dispatcher flat out LIED to us. They should have been honest at the beginning and told us that the driver was in Santa Rosa. If they cared about their client base at all they would offered us the choice of waiting or taking a credit to use toward a future ride. Instead they LIED and kept a very tired family waiting for TWO HOURS at SFO. 

I have been trying to reach the manager, Bey, for 2 days. She has yet to return my call.

So I was pretty baffled as to what the issue was with someone assisting me,  I even offered to try the gown on unassisted but the lady didn't even respond.  Actually, I think they were huddled around the upcoming weeks schedule, because I heard some debating and phone calls going on about THAT.  I just came at a bad time maybe?

Secondly:  The selection is off rack, 'discounted' wedding gowns.  I didn't see much of a price difference between this place and others that I have shopped.  Also, there's a pretty limited selection.  There is no order service provided, but they'll alter it.  The accessories seem priced as high as big bridal shop items I've seen, and maybe 2nd hand?  

I'm not a bridezilla, and I'm not in a last minute frenzy.  I went alone to avoid the whole wedding dress debacle with friends and family.  The service here, today, was absolutely inexcusable for a business as a whole.

first of all it's the largest of all the theaters by a long measure, so even though you're paying a lot for the ticket, it doesn't mean that you actually sit close at all.  for the same money you could buy a ticket for O or Mystere or Love, sit in a theater half the size, and you could even sit in the balcony and still be closer then a premium seat at Ka.

second of all.. the stunts are just terrible.. i see better stunts in a jet li movie, and at least there's no visible wires in the movie.  its really just terrible... the whole show is just a terrible chinatown parade mishmashed with asian martial arts demo.. seriously no artistry or amazing human feats at all..  might as well go see the circus circus midway shows for similar performances..

It's a real shame because their jjambbong is one of the best in the city; the yookgaejang, pajun, and banchan are all pretty good.. but the prices are absolutely obscene!!! Come on.. it doesn't cost THAT much to make Korean food!! $30-34 for one order of galbi?! $12.95 for all special dishes such as stews and noodles? $20 for PAJUN, which is probably the most obscene. 

I went to Jin Mee today with a group of friends and tried ordering AYCE bbq and they said they're currently not offering this deal because of the CES convention. I ordered my usual extra spicy jjambbong and they greatly disappointed me by saying that they don't make any of the dishes on their Chinese menu due to the convention. Last time we all came here, they said they couldn't make it because it was too late... this time they claimed they're not making it at all. I asked for the steamed egg (usually provided as a complimentary side dish with all Korean BBQ) and they said it would be $5 extra!! That was strike 3 that put me over the edge and extremely agitated...  Nevertheless, we tried to put it all aside and enjoy a good dinner with good company. THEN, as we were leaving the restaurant.. what did I see a few tables away from us??? A bowl of jjambbong that was served to a man, woman and their baby. I was officially appalled! 

I don't believe the people here know how to run a successful restaurant\/business or to be hospitable toward local regulars. Then, they take away all of their best assets during specific times when there are a lot of tourists in town... Sadly, my review went from 3 stars to 1 :(


My former review: 
I actually became a regular here and on average, my overall experience has not been so good. The food is fantastic, which is why I keep going back; however, I feel they do not run their restaurant properly. Their AYCE Korean BBQ is definitely their best asset and a great deal! The variety they offer for AYCE is generous and it's a great way to have a group dinner..... which is WHY I took my friends from LA here the other night, but they weren't offering AYCE because of the convention! She explained that during convention days, it's not an option. I also went there to order their jjambbong (my all-time favorite dish that's both Chinese and Korean), and they said their Chinese menu is limited to before 10pm. It was disappointing to be a hostess and show off a place I loved so much, only to be limited to the typical, overpriced Korean menu.... they have all these strict rules where they can't serve something a certain way, or you can't take the jjigae from AYCE home when it's actually not refillable, and extra rice costs $... these are all not how I portray a great Korean restaurant. Korean service is usually a lot more generous and flexible to your liking, and needless to say.. I was disappointed with the operations of this place. Also, they were not generous with the banchan (side dishes) either. The raw crab that I LOVE was not provided... it was more of a ""limited"" selection, all because of the convention that was going on. A restaurant should actually put its best foot forward in times of good business... and they most certainly did not.

The jjambbong for me was ""tied"" with the one from Elephant Snack next door, which so far are my favorite jjambbongs in Vegas. They still don't compare to the ones you can find in Los Angeles or NYC, so once again, I'm still on the hunt. If anyone has recommendations, please let me know!

Unless you're going as a group during a time when they provide AYCE BBQ, there are other Korean restaurants in Vegas I prefer that are more affordable, flexible, and the service is much friendlier.",4,1,1

As others have said their fresh oysters are good but unfortunately the last time I was there they weren't as sweet as others I've had.  But you MUST try their Pan Roast and Gumbo.  But if you have to choose only one then try their Pan Roast it's amazing!  I can't find anything like it anywhere else.  It's a hearty stew like dish with your choice of crab, oyster, shrimp, or combo (crab, shrimp, lobster) in a tomato cream sauce with a kick.  Depending on your spice level you can choose from 1-10.  My bf and I usualy go 6-7 and that's about a medium.  And their portions are huge and they don't skimp on the seafood either. We usually order one pan roast and an appetizer and we're stuffed.  Trust me it's enough, we're pretty big eaters.  When we first tried this place we ordered one pan roast and one gumbo then had a ton of leftovers enough for dinner.

Our server explained to us that there are 3 different tasting menus - $45, $55, and $65. But because we weren't too hungry, we decided to try the $45, which the server said consists of 4-5 dishes. However when our meal started, the food just kept coming! We ended up getting 10 dishes in total, including dessert. We were very surprised by this as we thought we were only going to have 4-5 dishes. We also thought maybe they made a mistake with our order and gave us the $65 tasting menu instead. But when the bill came, our whole meal only costed $45\/person which was very well worth the money. 

All the dishes tasted amazing (except for the Kung pao cauliflower which I wasn't too crazy about).

Aside from its trendy atmosphere and excellent service, I really liked their warm plates. I recommend...

KUROBUTA PORK CRISP
4 Hour Braised Black Pork Seared Tofu, Nihon Glaze

JAPANESE WAGYU STRIPLOIN
4 oz A4 , Black Truffle Ponzu, Roasted Shimeji and Maitake Mushrooms

SALMON AND BLACK COD
Pineapple Miso Salmon, Shiro Miso Black Cod

all of these dishes really satisfied my food fantasies. The crunchy shell made the pork very delightful to eat and the tofu on top made the display really pretty. And again being the well done meat eater that i am the wagyu beef was cooked perfectly and served deliciously with the maitake mushrooms and a light soy sauce...

For what you pay for, i really couldnt ask for more. Its a bit pricey but well worth the fresh fish and delicious warm plates...",0,0,0

The young lady that helped me was awesome (she no longer is there). I bought my dress that day. They encouraged me to come back for bridesmaid dresses. I wanted my girls to go pick out their dress in November ( wedding was the following September). I knew it could take 6 months to get dresses in and a lot of my girls live out of town, so I wanted them to have enough time and not be rushed. The shop encouraged me to not do it until February, so I scheduled an appointment. When we came in, no one would help us even though we had an appointment. I was so embarrassed because I said such good things. The dress the girls picked out, which was beautiful, had a belt on it that was not the color I  wanted. The lady from the shop said we could change the color of the belt to the color of the dress. A MONTH  later I get a phone call from the shop stating that we could not change the color of the belt. So 2 of my bridesmaids and I went back to pick out a different dress. The owner convinced me to stay with the same dress and the bridal shop would order extra fabric and put a belt on. I was told we would have the dresses at the end of June. I called the 1st week of July and was told they would be in in 2 weeks. I called back in 2 weeks then they couldn't find the tracking for the dresses! They didn't know where the dresses were. A couple hours later I got a phone call stating the dresses would be in first week in August. The dresses didn't come in until 2 weeks before my wedding! Then they still had to put on the belts which looked awful. One of my bridesmaid went to pick up her dress and was told ""this is ONLY a $180 dress. I don't understand why you think it's going to be perfect!"" I can't believe the owner would say such a thing to a customer.  The owner also told my friend that I had thousands of dresses to choose from and I had to have that one. If you remember she convinced me to stick with the original dress. When I called her to ask about the conversation she told me that I was not appreciative and like all her other brides and expected everything for nothing. I had not asked for anything and I'm not confrontational at all. She had me in tears! I could go on and on but I think you get the idea. Worst customer service and I would NEVER recommend them to anyone!  Be forewarned...",1,0,0

The food is hit or miss--order with caution and play it safe. The service...disservice.  What prompted this review was the fact that when I was eating my pork burrito last week (new item--terrible), I bit into a rind\/shell of some sort that clearly was not meant to be in there and was completely inedible--think exoskeleton meets cochinita. (Even if it wasn't in there, this was a confused burrito). As I was trying to carry on a conversation with my companions, I had to try to discreetly remove multiple shards of whatever the hell it was that they snuck into the damn thing.  I finally gave up on discretion and just spit out into my napkin.  Embarrassing? Check. Disgusting? Check. Forgivable? Well, when the skinny, checkered-shirt-wearing  manager(?) came to ""check on our meals"", I politely asked him what it could have been that accidentally got into my burrito. His response--""I dunno. Maybe pineapple husk or something..."" and he walked off.  No apology. No offer to replace the meal. No nothing. Just aloof, hipster douchebaggery.  Unforgivable.

The menu was lengthy, and the waitress suggested the fish and chips or corned beef. Well, the fish and chips were outstanding! I couldn't finish the fries.

I was concerned that he, or any artist at High Noon, wouldn't do it because I've been turned away before because the artist prefers to do original work. Never should have concerned me. Aaron was amazing, and when I offered him artistic license with the color scheme, he really took it to heart and made it very feminine but still bold. It's not in your face, but it doesn't back down. Like me!! He was done in 45 minutes and the detail is so precise, that my husband spent two hours taking it all in! It even appeals to my mom, who was very against the idea of me getting a second tattoo at all! 
The shop itself is very clean and styled to look like a wild west saloon. They did have the chiropractor's chair (my tattoo is on the low neck, mid shoulder area, and I was able to sit comfortably while I was being inked. Aaron waited until I was watching to pull out the individually wrapped, medically sterilized needle, which was also very reassuring! Absolutely the definition of professionalism for this business!! I am ecstatic and I'm thinking I may go in again for one of the original roses that they have there!! Beautiful!!!
With my pricing rating, I'm basing it on my opinion of the complexity of the tattoo, the intensity of the color and the time it took. I'm not willing to divulge the price I paid, I'll leave that up to the guys. One thing to keep in mind, is they only take cash, but I really can't say I blame them.

Maybe they were just having a bad day but based on what happened that day, we will NEVER go back.  Hubby mentioned that there was a nail in one of the tires to the owner....showed it to him as he took the tire out.

They gave him the runaround saying they were really busy and to go grab a coffee come back and then once again saying go home and come back in an hr or two.  So he went back later in the day, got the tires on and told me the hole where the nail was, was patched for free.  Great!

The next day, at hubby's place of employment, security did a walk around of the underground parking garage and  noticed  one of our tires was COMPLETELY FLAT!!  They did not repair the tire as promised.
Thankfully, he was able to get it repaired at a close Active Green & Ross near work or we would have been screwed!
