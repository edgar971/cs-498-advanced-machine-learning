    "The thing that makes neural networks really powerful is that they are able to do complex function approximation. As we saw earlier, we can organize the computation done in neural networks into units called *layers*. In a general neural network, there is an *input layer*, and an *output layer*. These may be the same layer as they were in our previous example. When they are not the same, there are intermediate layers known as _hidden layers_. These layers receive input from other layers and send their output to other layers. \n",

For our purposes, this just means that the output of the layer is just the dot product of its input `x`, its weights `w` plus a bias term `b`, all wrapped in a non-linear *activation function* `F`.  \n",

    "\n",
    "We'll now try to create a neural network with one hidden layer. This means that we have to come up with an activation function for the output of that hidden layer. A famous, simple but powerful activation function is the __Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)__ function defined nas `ReLU(x) = max(x,0)`. We will use this on the output of the hidden layer.\n",
